<P>The GIF format is not as well suited to compressing pictures with semi-random 
patterns of dots of differing colors, and it is even less suited to compressing 
images which have extremely subtle gradations of colors such as one might see in 
a photograph. The images at the right show closeups of such patterns. </P>
<P>On the other hand, the JPEG compression scheme, (also called <A 
href="http://catcode.com/imgguide/whyJPG.html">JPG</A>), has been designed to 
process photographic images. The bottom closeup takes up 6,456 bytes when saved 
as a GIF file, but only 1,573 bytes as a JPEG. </P>
<P>Rather than looking for patterns or runs of colors on a line-by-line basis, 
JPEG uses a mathematical formula based on the way your eyes perceive color. The 
JPEG compression algorithm looks at a pixel and its neighbors in all directions 
and finds the factors for that formula which will best represent all those 
pixels. Rather than storing the pixels, it compresses the image by storing only 
the factors. rather than the pixels, to save space. When you view the pictures, 
the JPEG process plugs the factors back into the formula and generates the 
pixels that best represent the original image. The key words here are “best 
represent.” </P>

<P>Note: The explanation of the JPEG algorithm above is a massive 
oversimplification. If you really, really want to know more, either see <A 
href="http://www.jpeg.org/public/jpeglinks.htm">the JPEG links page</A> or <A 
href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/compression-faq/part2/">the compression FAQ</A>, 
but be warned that the latter reference is not for the faint of heart. </P><!-- navigation -->
