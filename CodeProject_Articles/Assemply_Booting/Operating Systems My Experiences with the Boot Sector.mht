<P>When I first started playing with OS kind of topics, the first thing =
that I=20
did was make a bootsector that I stuck on a floppy... This was very =
interesting,=20
as I was basically crafting my own OS. Since then, I have been =
distracted to=20
work on other things... and the code has been rotting on my hard drive.
<P>When I was doing a clean up of my drive, I noticed it, and being the =
good=20
netizen that I am, I'm giving it away. Although I haven't tested it for =
more=20
than 3 years now, I believe it does do some stuff... so if you'd like to =
play=20
with it, scrap a floppy and copy the boot sector onto the disk.
<P>This also comes with a small set of utilities (and their source as =
well).=20
These were originally written in Turbo Pascal (I'm sorry! Really I am! =
:) with a=20
lot of inline assembler. If you don't have Turbo Pascal, you can either =
use the=20
included EXE file or convert them to C. If you do port them to C, please =
send=20
them my way and other people can use them.
<P>Oh, the catch... there's always a catch, isn't there? I haven't =
worked with=20
this stuff for over 3 years now... Which means that I probably won't be =
able to=20
do an adequate job explaining it... :) It is somewhat documented... and =
it has=20
function names that are longer than a character. Other than that, I =
can't offer=20
much support. There are some batch files in the source directory=20
(<TT>BOOTSEC</TT>) for doing things like compiling it and copying it =
onto the=20
disk. The tools directory (<TT>NEWFAT</TT>) has stuff the tools source =
and=20
executables in it.
<P>Pulling back very old memories, I remember that I was just starting =
to=20
implement a filesystem with program loading support... other than that, =
you're=20
on your own. :) If you would like to contribute something back to this =
page,=20
feel free to email it to me, and I'll put your stuff here (with full =
credits of=20
course)... Anyways, download it below!
