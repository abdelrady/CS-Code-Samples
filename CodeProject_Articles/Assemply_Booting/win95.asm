; Description:  Heroic attempt to disassemble the Windows 95 Boot Sector.
; Date:         16. Aug. 1998
; Author:       Mr. X
; Email:        unknown
; Comment:      This boot code is messy.
; Status:       PART I, II and III are now pretty much done.
; Important:    "SHLD EDX,EAX,16" This is a Microsoft Patent.
;               Also take a look at the "list near EOF"

;
; This file will assemble into a fully functional (I hope) Win95B boot code.
;
;  tasm win95 /m
;  tlink win95,win95.bin /t
;
; Ask someone for the proper dropper code...

;
; AFTER DISASSEMBLY I have this impression:
;
;  This is what Bill Gates said... when Win95 was going to be released:
;
;  "Gates: OK, then we're ready to press the CD's and start shipping out 
;   this new load of shit, but of course nobody will notice... harr harr.
;   Employee: Hey, Mr. Gates what about the Boot Sector?? We haven't 
;   written the FAT32 support routines there yet...
;   Gates: Ah, that's right... anybody?? We have just 45 minutes...
;   Employee #2: Well, I think I can hack some shit together...
;   Gates: Fine, go for it... remember you have only 44 minutes...
;   Employee #2: I think I can do it.
;   Gates: Fine, then I'll just go home... We've made it!!"
;
; FUNNY?
;
; There is some really strange code in this boot record....
;
; I bet Bill Gates hired some crazy fucker to write this shit.
; It seems like he had really tried to make the code fit within one sector.
; But when it didn't hid just decided to use three instead...
;
; This is a typical microsoft solution, they mix stupid 8086 code... with
; cheap solutions and then suddenly they use 386 code...
;
; And then there is the new FAT32 data structures where they have moved
; the volume label, FileSystem ID and serial number down to make room for
; some extended FAT32 variables... it sucks. Why not rearange the whole
; structure... An OS would not try to interpret the shit anyway, because
; the Partitioni Table SYSID has changed with FAT32.
;
; As I said... crazy fucker...
;
; Well, well... here's some of the stuff... with a mix of mine and sourcer's
; comments...
;
; Another thing about TASM, which I use, of course I didn't buy it... I'm
; have a shareware version ;) on a 30 year trial period.
;
; Back to what I was about to say again... When I use the brXXXX variables
; in indexing with BP, TASM generates 16-bit offset in operands even when
; they are less than 128... the Win95 code uses byte offsets (I'm not sure
; if I'm expressing myself clear here). When I changed the code from:
;
; mov AX,[bp+brHPC] to mov AX,[bp+128], TASM did use the byte offset form...
; This made my code a little less readable... but the comments should give
; you an idea of what data is being accessed.
;
; Basically this boot sector code is 32 bit extension for a 16 bit patch to
; an 8 bit boot sector originally coded for a 4 bit microprocessor, written
; by a 2 bit company, that can't stand 1 bit of competition.
