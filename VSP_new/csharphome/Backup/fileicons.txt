 * This file is read by the Browse page to display certain icons depending on their
 * extension.
 *
 * The file format is
 *
 * ;ext,ext,....
 * image location
 *
 * There must be a ";" at the begining of the extension list, and this list is separated
 * by commas. The following line must indicated the location of the image.
 * 
 * Comments and other writing are not read by the reader so long as it does not begin with
 * a ";", you can use VB style, HTML style, any style of commenting so long as it doesn't
 * start with that character. */
