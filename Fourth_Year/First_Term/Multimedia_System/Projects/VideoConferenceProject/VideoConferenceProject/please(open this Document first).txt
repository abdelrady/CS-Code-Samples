Hi Dr. khaled
in the "videoConferenceProject" folder we post our project presentation, the source code of the project and this small document to describe that we in previous post in the group the documentation of two projects "file sharing ,Image magick" which were not be accepted But in this project we post the presentation only because we find that it covers all the data we may display in the documentation.
we divided the work in the project into two task the first task is responsible for(1) recording and playing Audio (2) encoder and decoder and me will work in this task.
the second task is responsible for video capture and shimaa omar will work in this task.
Dr.khaled 
please, when you see our project take in your mind that the multimedia lab has many problems, this is our first deal with
 codes which is downloaded from code projects web sites and that we made our best effort to make our project be accepted.

                thanks for your interest
