Description: It is a class that can generate barcode 39. It contain a demo to show the basic element to use the class. It can be use even a beginer. It can be draw on form, printer, and picture. I am post the example to it because I don't have barcode reader to test the barcode that has been generated.(no money, >,<....) It is part of my assignment. However, I have check the barcode "line" with the pay money barcode activeX , and it appear correct for all the charater. It is runable and 100% complete. For all the gentlemen and beautiful lady, if you have a barcode reader, pleaseeeee download it and test it. Please copy the result and post here if can. It contain a test function that come with demo(I don't know it can be done or not, I write it with theory).Thank you very much.
