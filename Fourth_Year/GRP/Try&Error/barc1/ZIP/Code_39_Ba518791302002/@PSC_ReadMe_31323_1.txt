Title: Code 39 Barcoder
Description: Draws a image of a bar code and saves it to disk. From there you can use it in crystal reports, or any printing application. I have tested this with dot matrix printers, lasers and ink jet. Works great. You should place only upper case characters and numerics in the string for render.
