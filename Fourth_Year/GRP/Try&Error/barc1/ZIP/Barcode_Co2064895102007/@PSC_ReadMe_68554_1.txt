Title: Barcode Code128 Generator without using fonts
Description: A barcode generator. Right now only accepts a subset of Code128B (A-Z &amp; 0-9) but can print all that is required by the Code128 check character.
Output is verified correct using my Argox barcode scanner.
If you want to test it, do a print screen and paste the generated barcode into MS Word. Then print using Word's "High Quality" print setting
Doesn't use any barcode fonts, just the Line statement.
