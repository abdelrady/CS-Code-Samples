Title:- 3 of 9 Barcode Creator

Very simple custom barcode generator using a free barcde font ( free 3 of 9 extended) included in the zip file.
Allows you to create the barcode and see what you have done then resize the viewport to better fit the barcode then preview and save the barcode in bitmap format, ready to use in most graphics programs.
Place the font after extracting it from the zip file in the windows font folder
