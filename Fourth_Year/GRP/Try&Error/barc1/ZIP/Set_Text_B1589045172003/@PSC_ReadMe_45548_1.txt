Title: Set Text Back Color in Rich Text Box (Using SendMessage API call)
Description: This uses a standard RichText control and allows you to set the background color of individual selections of text. I did not want to use one of the several custom ocx controls people have made to do this in my projects. The standard RichText control is crippled by default; it removes all \highlight# codes. This code gets around that by using the SendMessage API call. It is very simple to use. Update (05/17/2003 15:45 CST) I have not checked if anyone has submitted anything similiar in a few months. Apparently, CodeId 44074 (http://www.pscode.com/vb/scripts/showcode.asp?txtCodeId=44074&lngWId=1) and CodeId 43509 (http://www.pscode.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=43509&lngWId=1) are both meant to do the same thing. CodeId 44074 does not actually work. CodeId 43509 does work, but I feel my code would be easier to implement in another program. My code allows you to pass a color to the sub which sets the background color, rather that only yellow as in CodeId 43509.
