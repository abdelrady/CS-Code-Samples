Title: Easiest ever Barcode Encoder
Description: This encoder actually works (ie produces a valid barcode that will return the inputted text when scanned), and it's really really (REALLY) short & simple!
It uses the Code 128 symbology so can accept any alpha-numeric characters as well as some special characters.
