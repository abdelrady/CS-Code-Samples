Unzip all files in Matlab current directory
and type "facerec" on Matlab command window.

Faces.zip is a collection of faces taken from  AT&T database.










Face images must be collected into sets: every set (called "class") should
include a number of images for each person, with some variations in 
expression and in the lighting. When a new input image is read and added
to the training database, the number of class is required. Otherwise, a new 
input image can be processed and confronted with all classes present in database.
We choose a number of eigenvectors M' equal to the number of classes (see 
algorithmic details in the cited references). Before start image
processing first select input image. This image can be succesively added to
database (training) or, if a database is already present, matched with
known faces.

The images included are taken from AT&T Laboratories Cambridge's
Face DataBase. See the cited references for more informations.


FUNCTIONS

Select image:                                  read the input image

Add selected image to database:                the input image is added to database and will be used for training

Database Info:                                 show informations about the images present in database. Images must 
                                               have the same size. If this is not true you have to resize them.

Face Recognition:                              face matching. The selected input image is processed 

Delete Database:                               remove database from the current directory

Info:                                          show informations about this software

Visualization tool:                            visualization utility

Source code for Face Recognition System:       how to obtain the complete source code

Exit:                                          quit program
