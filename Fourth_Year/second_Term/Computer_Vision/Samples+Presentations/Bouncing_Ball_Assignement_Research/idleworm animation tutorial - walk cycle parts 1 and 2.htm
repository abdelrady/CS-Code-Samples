      face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size=2>Most sane people have a fear of 
      animating walk cycles. Many events are happening at the same time, and it 
      can seem overwhelming. A single mistake on your first drawing can wreck 
      the rest of the scene. However, the process can be broken down into a 
      series of steps which can go some distance in simplifying the process. 
      <P>A walk cycle can be described by four distinct poses:
      <P><FONT color=white size=3>
      <CENTER><B>CONTACT, RECOIL, PASSING</B> and 
      <B>HIGH-POINT.</B></CENTER></FONT>
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=190 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - walk cycle parts 1 and 2_files/wlk01.gif" 
      width=580> </CENTER>
      <P>These four poses and a handful of inbetween drawings constitute a walk 
      cycle. The single most important frame of the four is the contact pose. 
      Once you draw it you have already determined 80% of the rest of your walk. 
      If you make a mistake on your contact pose, it can be very difficult to 
      correct later on. Therefore: pay close attention now and save yourself a 
      world of pain. 
      <P>Here is the contact pose in front and side view. 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=435 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - walk cycle parts 1 and 2_files/wlk02.gif" 
      width=580> </CENTER>
      <P>Look at the pose carefully. You will notice some very important 
      details: The feet are at their furthest extension in the walk. That is 
      their most extreme position in the cycle. That alone makes this the most 
      critical pose in the sequence. You can plan an entire walk sequence just 
      by laying out all the contact poses as they work into one another. 
      <P><B>Some animators think that the recoil and high points are the most 
      important poses because the head is at its highest and lowest positions. 
      This is wrong. The contact pose is the fundamental building block of a 
      walk cycle. If you do not start your cycle with this pose, then you are 
      doomed. It's as simple as that.</B> 
      <P>When the right foot is forward, the right arm is back, and vice versa. 
      This is called "counterpose". This is how nature keeps everything in 
      balance when you move: one side of the body "opposes" the other. Good 
      animation has these "opposing actions" all the time. If animation seems 
      weak or unnatural to you, it is frequently because it lack opposing 
      action. You can think of a walk as a series of "falls". The character 
      propels himself forward by leaning into the walk as he moves forward. His 
      trailing foot constantly swings forward to catch himself before he moves 
      on to the next "fall" in the sequence. It shares many attributes with the 
      bouncing ball in tutorial 1. Look at the front on view. 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=435 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - walk cycle parts 1 and 2_files/wlk03.gif" 
      width=580> </CENTER>
      <P>I have drawn in imaginary cylinders to illustrate the orientation of 
      the shoulders and hips. Again, as one is thrust forward, the other is 
      thrust back. As one tilts up, the other tilts down.<BR>Another name for 
      this is "Torque". It is a fundamental principle of good posing. It should 
      be an element of almost every figure drawing that you do. Michelangelo 
      always used torque in his sculptures, creating dynamic poses, even in ones 
      that were standing still. One hip takes the weight, while the other 
      passively provides the balance.<BR>The body is very rarely symmetrical: 
      indeed, symmetry can be your enemy. 
      <P>Now look at the recoil pose, the second main pose in the cycle. 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=435 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - walk cycle parts 1 and 2_files/wlk04.gif" 
      width=580> </CENTER>
      <P>This is the frame where the character impacts the ground. It is also 
      the lowest point in the cycle. The characters arms are furthest from the 
      body as a result of the force of hitting the ground. The front foot is 
      fully in contact with the ground; the rear foot has just lifted up from 
      it.<BR>Note that the leading foot is directly beneath the body, supporting 
      the weight above it. Too many beginners produce recoil poses where the 
      foot is not beneath the body, but several inches ahead of it. Try to avoid 
      this. 
      <P>To keep things simple, let's skip the passing pose...it's closer to 
      being an inbetween. Let's look at the high point. 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=435 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - walk cycle parts 1 and 2_files/wlk05.gif" 
      width=580> </CENTER>
      <P>This is the highest point in the cycle. The character's body is 
      stretched to the maximum as he lifts his leading leg forward to reach the 
      next contact position. The heel of the trailing foot is just beginning to 
      leave the ground. 
      <P>Those are the three most important poses to remember when creating a 
      walk animation. If you can wrap your head around them, you will have a 
      much better chance of completing a satisfactory walk cycle. 
      <P>There are two basic ways to animate a walk cycle. You can animate the 
      cycle "in place" or across the screen. Here is the same scene shown in 
      each style.

      </OBJECT><BR>In place</CENTER>
      <P>Why animate in place? There is one main advantage: 
      <P>You only have to draw a single stepping cycle, then you can reposition 
      it across the screen, saving time and paper. 
      <P>The main disadvantages of animating in place:<BR>1.It can be 
      confusing.<BR>2.The "arcs" on the character can look weird when the 
      character is moved across the screen.<BR>3.It can be difficult to match 
      the character properly to the background, if he has to register to 
      something on it. 
      <P>I am going to show you how to animate a character walking across the 
      page. Once you feel comfortable with that, an in-place walk cycle should 
      be slightly less intimidating. 
      <P>Let's begin.
      <P>Look at this image: 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=435 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - walk cycle parts 1 and 2_files/wlk08.gif" 
      width=580> </CENTER>
      <P>This shows the keyframes of a walk cycle moving across the screen. The 
      most important pose is the contact pose. Use this image as an overall 
      guide to your scene. 
      <P><B>1.Guideline.</B><BR>On a clean sheet of paper, draw two parallel 
      horizontal lines moving across the bottom of the page. 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=435 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - walk cycle parts 1 and 2_files/wlk09.gif" 
      width=580> </CENTER>
      <P>These are the lines that the feet will follow as they walk across the 
      page. Without these lines to guide you, your character can drift either 
      too high or too low on the page. 
      <P><B>2.Draw the first contact pose.</B><BR>Put a clean sheet of paper 
      down over the guideline drawing. You are going to draw the first contact 
      drawing. 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=435 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - walk cycle parts 1 and 2_files/wlk10.gif" 
      width=580> </CENTER>
      <P>Position the heel of the right foot on the lower line; position the 
      toes of the left foot on the upper line. Name this drawing #1, and since 
      it is a contact pose I usually write the letter "c" in the top right of 
      the page, above and away from the frame number. (This is a habit of mine, 
      I don't know if anyone else does it....you will find that it helps to 
      reduce confusion when you have 12 drawings flying all over your drawing 
      board.) Don't forget to circle the drawing number, since it is a key. 
      <P><B>3. Draw the second contact pose, drawing 7.</B><BR>If you have a 
      backlight then switch it on. Put down a clean sheet. Number it #7. Circle 
      the number, as this is a key frame. Write the letter "C" above the frame 
      number, to remind you that it's a contact pose. 
      <P>Note that the second contact pose occurs about half a second after the 
      first. Here's how you position the second contact relative to the first: 
      The leading foot on #1 will be the trailing foot on #7. In this case the 
      right foot is about to contact the ground on #1. In frames #1 through #7 
      it is going to hit the ground and more or less stay there. By frame #7 it 
      will have begun to lift off the ground. Look at the picture below to see 
      how #1 works into #7: 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=435 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - walk cycle parts 1 and 2_files/wlk11.gif" 
      width=580> </CENTER>
      <P>The right foot (the leading one) has touched the ground and the entire 
      body has moved forward. The left foot (the far one) has now swung forward 
      and is now about to contact the ground.<BR>Lightly sketch it in, keeping 
      the overall attitude as similar to #1 as possible. The only differences 
      will be the arms, legs and orientation of the hips, all of which will be 
      reversals of #1.<BR>After you have roughly sketched in the second contact 
      pose, you'll have to check it against the first. Lift #7 off the pegs, and 
      position it over #1. Flip #1 against #7 to see that both drawings have the 
      same volume and attitude. You don't want either to look bigger or smaller 
      than the other. Also, both should be leaning forward into the walk at the 
      same angle. If not, your walk will look more like a limp.
      <P>Now that you have drawn these two poses, you can begin to block in the 
      main keys between them. First, an overview of what is going to happen. 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=435 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - walk cycle parts 1 and 2_files/wlk13.gif" 
      width=580> </CENTER>
      <P>Here are the main keys. The contact, recoil and high point drawings. 
      Remember these positions when you begin to draw them in on their own 
      sheets of paper. If you were to positon #2 too high for example, it would 
      make #5 very difficult to draw properly: the overall action would be too 
      "tight"...not enough bounce in the walk. 
      <P>This would feel like a very stiff cycle, unnatural for a cartoony 
      character. See what I mean below: 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=435 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - walk cycle parts 1 and 2_files/wlk14.gif" 
      width=580> </CENTER>
      <P>The opposite is also dangerous: moving the recoil too far down can 
      result in a wildly exagerrated action, too unbelievable for all but the 
      weirdest characters: 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=435 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - walk cycle parts 1 and 2_files/wlk15.gif" 
      width=580> </CENTER>
      <P>Just bear in mind that after the first contact, the character works 
      down into the recoil, then up into the high point, then back into the next 
      contact where the pattern is repeated: 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=435 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - walk cycle parts 1 and 2_files/wlk16.gif" 
      width=580> </CENTER>
      <P><B>4. Draw the recoil pose</B><BR>(Bear in mind my rant in the previous 
      paragraph). Put down a clean sheet, number it #2 in the top right of the 
      page, write the letter "R" beside that, and draw the character as his foot 
      hits the ground. The character will be at his lowest point in the cycle. 
      Don't move the head and body too far forward or you can inadvertently 
      cause any number of arcing problems later on. 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=435 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - walk cycle parts 1 and 2_files/wlk17.gif" 
      width=580> </CENTER>
      <P>I find as a general rule of thumb that the body should fall by half a 
      head to one head in height to keep the walk "bouncy" enough. (It's a 
      common beginner's mistake to keep the figure at the same height throughout 
      the entire walk.) 
      <P>Remember...the recoil position will be almost identical later in the 
      walk, on the subsequent step: 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=435 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - walk cycle parts 1 and 2_files/wlk18.gif" 
      width=580> </CENTER>
      <P>This is what will determine the overall arc pattern, and the positions 
      of all the poses inbetween the recoil and the following contact pose. On 
      the recoil pose the character impacts the ground. The rear foot lifts off, 
      and the arms are extended to their maximum from the body because of the 
      force of hitting the ground. 
      <P>Now a brief note on the overall timing of a walk.<BR>The most general 
      type of walk cycle is completed over the course of one second. This means 
      that the character makes a single step every half second. This is known as 
      hitting beats, and luckily two beats a second is a typical musical 
      pattern, or so I'm told. We're animating this scene on the typical 12 
      frames per second, therefore the overall sequence of drawings so far will 
      look like this: 
      <P>#01:contact<BR>#02:recoil<BR>#03:<BR>#04:<BR>#05:<BR>#06:<BR>#07:contact 
      (much like #1, but for the reversal of the legs and arms). 
      <BR>#08:recoil<BR>#09:<BR>#10:<BR>#11:<BR>#12:<BR>#13:contact ( a 
      duplicate of #1, only further to the right). 
      <P>As you can see, a complete cycle works from #01 to #12, beginning its 
      repeat on#13. I put the recoil immediately following the contact without 
      an inbetween between them because an inbetween frame would make it look 
      "mushy". The contact should usually snap into the recoil immediately, 
      without an intervening drawing.<BR>As you can see, I have not named the 
      frame that the high point will go on. I could assign it as #4 #05 or #06. 
      A different frame number will make quite a difference to the properties of 
      the character. Here is why: 
      <P>If #04 is the high point the walk will look like this: 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=435 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - walk cycle parts 1 and 2_files/wlk19.gif" 
      width=580> </CENTER>
      <P>As you can see above, this makes the character "bounce off the ground 
      very quickly, making him light footed. 
      <P>If #06 is the high point the walk will look like this: 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=435 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - walk cycle parts 1 and 2_files/wlk20.gif" 
      width=580> </CENTER>
      <P>This timing above slows down the character as he rises from the recoil 
      pose, making him seem a lot heavier. 
      <P>I will take the middle path and name the high point #05, resulting in 
      this: 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=435 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - walk cycle parts 1 and 2_files/wlk21.gif" 
      width=580> </CENTER>
      <P>This is a more even timing: it should make the character seem like an 
      average weight, without any extreme attributes. These are the kinds of 
      decisions that you should make before you begin animating. Now we can look 
      at our overall exposure sequence again: 
      <P>#01:contact<BR>#02:recoil<BR>#03:<BR>#04:<BR>#05:high 
      point.<BR>#06:<BR>#07:contact (much like #1, but for the reversal of the 
      legs and arms).<BR>#08:recoil (like #02, arms and legs 
      reversed).<BR>#09:<BR>#10:<BR>#11:high point. (like #05, arms and legs 
      reversed).<BR>#12:<BR>#13:contact ( a duplicate of #1, only further to the 
      right). 
      <P>Now we have our 3 main key frames, #1 #2 and #5, and their near twins 
      #7 #8 and #11. The empty spaces in the sequence above will all be 
      inbetweens. Don't worry about them yet.<BR>For now we will focus on #1 
      thru # 07, finishing a single step. 
      <P><B>5. Draw the high point.</B><BR>Put down a clean sheet. As explained 
      above, this will be drawing number #5. Write the number in the top right 
      of the page. Circle it. Write a small letter "H" above the number. Now 
      begin the drawing: 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=435 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - walk cycle parts 1 and 2_files/wlk22.gif" 
      width=580> </CENTER>
      <P>You have a little more freedom when drawing the limbs on the high point 
      than on the recoil, as the leading foot is up in the air, and the arms are 
      swinging over a pretty wide space. That gives you a number of different 
      possibilities. The example frame that I have included is fairly typical. 
      <P>The most important thing to get right with this drawing is the arc path 
      of the head and body. A mistake on this one frame will effect all the 
      inbetween frames around it. 
      <P>
      <P>Once that is finished, you are ready to move on. 
      <P><B>6.Add the timing charts.</B><BR>Before you do anything else, you 
      should add the timing charts to describe the correct positions of the 
      inbetweens. Here are the drawings we have finished so far: 
      <P>#01:contact<BR>#02:recoil<BR>#03:<BR>#04:<BR>#05:high 
      point.<BR>#07:contact (much like #1, but for the reversal of the legs and 
      arms). 
      <P>Timing charts need to be added to #2 and #5. The timing chart on #2 
      will describe the positions of #3 and #4 as they work into #5. The chart 
      on #5 will describe the position of #6. 
      <P>Put #2 on the drawing board. Underneath the frame number in the top 
      right corner of the page, you will add the chart. Here's what it should 
      look like: 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=435 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - walk cycle parts 1 and 2_files/wlk23.gif" 
      width=580> </CENTER>
      <P>As you can see, #4 is the main inbetween halfway between the two 
      keyframes. #3 is a smaller inbetween which will completely smooth out the 
      motion. 
      <P>The next timing chart to be added is on #5. Put #5 on the drawing board 
      and write a timing chart beneath the drawing number in the top right 
      corner of the page. It should look like this: 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=435 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - walk cycle parts 1 and 2_files/wlk24.gif" 
      width=580> </CENTER>
      <P>This shows that #6 will be a single inbetween halfway between #5 and 
      #7. Now it's time to draw the inbetweens. 
      <P><B>7.Draw #4: the main inbetween.</B><BR>Be sure that you have the 
      guideline drawing on the drawing board.Put #2 on the pegs. Now put #5 
      above that. Put a clean sheet on top of all three. Switch on the 
      backlight. Now you must draw #4, also known as the "passing position". 
      Some treat it as a key also, but to simplify things, I'm treating it as an 
      inbetween. I've never really found it to be as critical as contact, recoil 
      or high point poses. 
      <P>You have to flip between #4 and the two key frames beneath it. You 
      should remember that from the bouncing ball tutorial: 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=104 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - walk cycle parts 1 and 2_files/flip1.gif" 
      width=138></CENTER>
      <P>Again, be sure that your character follows the arc path as he walks. 
      When you're finished the drawing, remove the drawings from the pegs and 
      place #2, #4 and #5 back on the pegs in that sequence. Now you can roll 
      them to see if they move properly. You'll also remember that from the 
      bouncing ball tutorial. 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=104 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - walk cycle parts 1 and 2_files/roll1.gif" 
      width=138></CENTER>
      <P>If you see any errors in your inbetween, then you must lift the 
      drawings off the pegs again, then place #2 on the bottom, #5 above it, and 
      #4 on the top. Then you can flip again, correcting any errors that may 
      have crept in. It's tedious, but it's the only way to do it. 
      <P><B>8.Draw the remaining inbetweens.</B><BR>Repeat step 7 with #3 and 
      #6. If you do them right then you should be finished with the first half 
      of the walk cycle. I hope you had fun, but I doubt it. 
      <P>You should be looking at a stack of paper, numbered #1 through #7. If 
      you put all those drawings on the pegs, you should be able to roll them 
      and have a rough idea of what your scene will look like when it's shot. If 
      anything catches your eye, chances are it's wrong. Go back in, repeating 
      the process described in step 7, until you're happy with it. 
      <P><B>9.Finish the rest of the cycle (or else).</B><BR>Repeat the steps 
      above to complete the rest of the walk cycle. You'll have to draw #13 (the 
      third contact pose) to work into. Simply trace off the pose on #1 onto #13 
      in its new position, further to the right. If it took 2 inches to make a 
      single step from #1 to#7, then slide #13 over 4 inches to the left and 
      start tracing... 
      <P>I hope that makes sense. 
      <P>The second half of the walk is identical to the first, except that the 
      arms and legs will be on the opposite sides of the body.<BR>Indeed, you 
      can refer to the first half of your scene to help you with the second. The 
      recoil pose on #8 should be as similar to the recoil pose on #2 as 
      possible, otherwise the walk may seem uneven, or even more like a limp. 
      <P><B>10. A general note about arcs.</B><BR>Every joint of the body has 
      its own arc path. It's a good idea to check them all. Here's how. 
      <P>Place all your drawings on the board. If you have a backlight switch it 
      on. Pick a body part, e.g. the right wrist. Place a clean sheet over the 
      drawings and draw a small dot on it at the position of the right wrist on 
      frame 1. On the same sheet draw a dot for the position fof the wrist for 
      #2...and so on. 
      <P>By the time you're finished you'll have a sheet of paper that looks 
      like this: 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=240 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - walk cycle parts 1 and 2_files/wlk25.gif" 
      width=320></CENTER>
      <P>That's what it looks like if it's done properly. If you've made an arc 
      mistake, it'll look like this: 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=240 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - walk cycle parts 1 and 2_files/wlk26.gif" 
      width=320></CENTER>
      <P>If your walk is to look smooth and natural, your arc paths must also be 
      smooth, curved, natural shapes. You should repeat this process for every 
      part of the body to make sure they all move properly. 
      <P>If you're new to this: draw simple cartoony characters at first. Don't 
      even think of attempting anatomical designs until you've gotten 
      comfortable with the simple ones first.<BR>That's all for now!
