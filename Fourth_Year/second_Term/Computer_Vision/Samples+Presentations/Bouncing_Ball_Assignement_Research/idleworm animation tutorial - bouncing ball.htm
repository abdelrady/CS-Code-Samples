      size=2><B>NOTE:</B> I wrote this tutorial in 2000, and intended it for 
      students learning traditional, hand-drawn animation. Nevertheless, the 
      principles can be adapted to Flash or 3D animation. The main tutorial page 
      is <A href="http://www.idleworm.com/how/index.shtml">here</A> (there's a 
      walk cycle tuturial, and I'll be adding Flash lessons soon).<BR><BR>This 
      boring exercise will teach you the most important priciples of animation, 
      namely:

      any animation student. You can pay through the nose to learn it at a 
      school, but I am giving it to you for free, so behold! Look at the 
      bouncing ball scene below: 
      <P>

      type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="590" height="369"></embed>  
      </OBJECT></CENTER>
      <P>Look at it again with all the frames superimposed. 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=369 alt="figure 1 - arcs with bouncing balls overlaid" 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - bouncing ball_files/bal01.gif" 
      width=590></CENTER>
      <P>Now some of the techniques used become easier to see. 
      <P>1. <B>Arcs.</B> The ball falls in an elliptical arc through space. Most 
      things move in an arc of some kind. If the ball were to move in a straight 
      line between the high and low points of the bounce, then the action would 
      look very unnatural. 
      <P>2. <B>Timing.</B> (or Spacing). As the ball falls it is accelerated by 
      gravity, the gap between each frame growing all the time until the ball 
      contacts the ground. As the ball bounces from the ground the opposite 
      happens: as the ball hops up it moves very fast at first, then slows down 
      by gravity into the high piont of its bounce. Note that at the high point 
      of the bounce the ball is weightless...perfectly balanced between the 
      force of gravity pulling it down, and its own momentum moving it forward. 
      <P>3. <B>Squash and Stretch.</B> As the ball falls it stretches. When it 
      impacts the ground it squashes. When it bounces off the ground it 
      stretches again. Note how quickly the ball regains its circular shape. Too 
      much squash and stretch can make an object look "mushy". 
      <P>4. <B>Volume.</B> The ball should remain the same mass as it squashes 
      and stretches. If the ball were to squash too much it would seem to be 
      growing physically bigger. This is very eye catching, and looks weird. 
      <P><B>How to animate the ball.</B> The process of animating the ball is 
      straightforward. On a single sheet of paper, draw the arc path that the 
      ball will follow. 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=363 alt="figure 2: bouncing ball arcs" 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - bouncing ball_files/bal02.gif" 
      width=580></CENTER>
      <P>On this drawing, tick off the position of each ball on the arc path 
      with an X. Be sure to number them. In feature and tv animation, frames are 
      usually numbered 1,3,5,7,9 and so on. To simplify things here, let's 
      number them 1,2,3,4, etc. For an explanation of why odd numbers are used 
      in animation, see the appendix at the bottom of the page. It's really 
      boring, and should be a really nice cure for insomnia. 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=363 alt="figure 3: arcs with frame numbers" 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - bouncing ball_files/bal03.gif" 
      width=580></CENTER>
      <P>If you have a backlight, then switch it on. Put a clean sheet over the 
      arc path drawing. Now you are ready to begin drawing the "Key" drawings of 
      the animation: the points where the ball is at its most extreme. In this 
      example, its highest and lowest points in the bounce.As you can see, frame 
      1 is the first and highest point in the sequence. It is therefore an 
      extreme drawing. Frame 7 is the squash drawing where the ball hits the 
      ground. It is also an extreme, as are drawings 12,17,21,25,28 and 31. 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=363 alt="figure 4: arcs and extreme ball positions" 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - bouncing ball_files/bal04.gif" 
      width=580></CENTER>
      <P>On seperate sheets of paper, you should draw the different key frames 
      as named above. If done correctly you should have a series of drawing 
      numbered 1,7,12,17,21,25,28 and 31.Be sure that you write the frame 
      numbers on the top right and bottom right of each drawing. If your drawing 
      is a key frame (as these are) then put a circle around the number. 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=363 alt="figure 5: drawing 1" 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - bouncing ball_files/bal05.gif" 
      width=580></CENTER>
      <P>Place them on the peg bar with the lower numbers on the bottom and the 
      higher numbers on the top. Now you are ready to "roll" the drawings. 
      <P><B>How to Roll the drawings:</B>A lot of people working in animation 
      seem to forget how tricky this is. It is a fairly easy skill, it just 
      takes a little practice. Do it slowly at first, as you progress you'll 
      begin to do it instinctively. There are people working in the industry who 
      aren't smart enough to chew gum and fart at the same time, and they can do 
      it. So don't worry. It takes a little time, but you'll get the hang of it. 

      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=104 alt="rolling paper" 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - bouncing ball_files/roll1.gif" 
      width=138></CENTER>
      <P>Back to the ball: Now you must add the inbetween frames. These are the 
      drawings that go between the keys in order to make the action look smooth. 
      Some people outside the industry call them "tweens". NO ONE WHO WORKS IN A 
      TRADITIONAL ANIMATION STUDIO USES THAT WORD. DON'T USE IT UNLESS YOU ENJOY 
      BEING SNIGGERED AT. The correct term is "inbetween". 
      <P>All frames are equal, but some frames are more equal than others. You 
      must determine which is the most important frame to draw next. Which has 
      the most important action? 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=363 alt="figure 6: main stretch drawing" 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - bouncing ball_files/bal06.gif" 
      width=580></CENTER>
      <P>In this case, the most important is frame 6. It is the most stretched 
      frame in the falling sequence. Therefore I would consider this almost as 
      much a key frame as 1 and 7. If you have a backlight, switch it on. Put 
      the arc path drawing on the pegs first. Then put down 1. Put down 7. Then 
      put down a blank sheet. You should see something like this: 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=363 alt="figure 7: first two keyframes" 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - bouncing ball_files/bal07.gif" 
      width=580></CENTER>
      <P>Now you are going to draw frame 6. Begin to sketch in the stretched 
      ball. When stretching the ball, keep the volume consistent. The overall 
      mass of the ball must be the same. Position it around the x drawn on the 
      arc path. When you have finished, you will have to flip the paper to see 
      if it moves right: 
      <P><B>How to flip the drawings:</B> 
      <P>Flipping is similar to rolling, but whereas with rolling you move 
      through the pages sequentially, here you move from the bottom drawing, to 
      the top one, then to the middle one. "WHY?" you ask....because this way 
      you can see the inbetween in motion and make subtle corrections as you 
      work. Incredible as it seems, this method is far more accurate than a 
      lighttable. 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=104 alt="flipping paper" 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - bouncing ball_files/flip1.gif" 
      width=138></CENTER>
      <P>Watch the paper closely. Notice that both index and middle fingers are 
      wedged between the top two layers. You begin flipping by holding up both 
      top sheets of paper towards you. You are now looking at the lowest frame, 
      frame 1. Then you drop the two sheets down to the board, revealing the 
      topmost drawing, i.e. the inbetween frame. Then you lift up the top 
      drawing to reveal the one in the middle, i.e the final keyframe. It takes 
      time to get the hang of this. It will be well worth the effort if you do. 
      <P>Now you will need to add the remaining inbetween drawings between 1 and 
      5. The easiestway to do this is with a timing chart. Lets look at what 
      we've got so far: 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=363 
      alt="figure 8: the spacing of the first 7 drawings" 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - bouncing ball_files/bal09.gif" 
      width=580></CENTER>
      <P>You could "eyeball" all the remaining frames, but the surest way to do 
      them is by writing a timing chart. It will look something like this: 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=363 alt="figure 9: the timing chart" 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - bouncing ball_files/bal10.gif" 
      width=580></CENTER>
      <P>The timing chart will go on frame 1, beneath the frame number on the 
      top right of the drawing. This chart tells you that the next most 
      important drawing is 5. That's why it's underlined. Note how the spacing 
      on the timing chart relates to the spacing on the arc path above. The 
      chart can determine the position of all the inbetween frames, and also 
      their weight, mass, speed, etc. 
      <P>Now you have keyframe 1 with a timing chart, and keyframe 6. Simply 
      follow the chart, place the arc path on your drawing board, then 1, Then 
      6, and proceed to follow the timing chart. Draw 5. 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=363 alt="figure 10:  keep the ball shapes solid" 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - bouncing ball_files/bal11.gif" 
      width=580></CENTER>
      <P>Note: see how quickly the ball regained its shape...if you were to 
      inbetween the shape as well as the position of the ball then the ball 
      would feel very mushy...by drawing 5 as circular, the scene will be much 
      snappier. Repeat inbetweening until the first arc of the bounce is 
      complete. Repeat the process for all frames of the scene. 
      <P>I have included all the original frames for this scene as digital 
      files. They should print out onto regular A4 printer paper. You can print 
      them out and peg them up onto strips of punched paper, allowing you to 
      roll through the scene. You line them up with the crosshairs on the 
      corners of the page. Simply paste up frame 1 as you like it, then put it 
      on your drawing board. Then put down a strip of punched paper, and 
      position frame 2 with its crosshairs lined up with frame 1. 
      <P>IMPORTANT: all frames should be positioned against frame 1, otherwise 
      the scene will "drift". 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=363 alt="drawing board" 
      src="idleworm animation tutorial - bouncing ball_files/board.gif" 
      width=580></CENTER>
      <P>You can find the files here: <A 
      href="http://www.idleworm.com/how/anm/01b/assets.rar">Bouncing ball image 
      files</A> . You'll need winrar to decompress them (most zip programs 
      should work on them). 
      <P>Appendix: Numbering drawings. 
      <P>Most animation is still produced for film and tv. Film is projected at 
      24 frames per second (fps). Early cartoons were all drawn with 24 drawings 
      for every second of film, i.e. onedrawing for every frame of film. Some 
      clever chap finally realised that the animation looked just as good if 
      only 12 drawings were drawn per second of film. Each drawing would be shot 
      twice, to keep the overall timing the same. Nobody noticed the difference, 
      and a lot of carpal tunnel doctors went out of business. 
      <P>This discovery can be attributed entirely to prohibition. Animators of 
      the twenties were notorious alcoholics. Not these days, glad to say. 
      Today's breed are wholesome family men, loyal to their wives, good 
      fathers, upstanding members of society, clean living wackos. 
      <P>The practice of animating 12 fps is called animating "on twos", and the 
      practice of animating 24 fps is called animating "on ones". It was still 
      occasionally necessary to animate scenes on ones if a fast action was 
      required, or if the camera panned over the background, i.e. move from left 
      to right to follow a character across the screen. Such shots would look 
      jerky if shot on twos. 
      <P>When working on twos the animators usually number their frames with odd 
      numbers. 1,3,5 and so on. Frame one is shot twice, frame two is shot 
      twice, ad nauseum. If a point in the scene demands a fast action such as a 
      punch or a shake, then the scene can be switched to ones at thatpoint. The 
      numbering can then include the even numbers that will make the action 
      smoother. 
      <P>If all this sounds like gibberish, don't worry. It's not relevant to 
      anything in the next few lessons. 
      <P>One last comment about timing: Today a lot of animation is made on 
      computers, and can be projected at any frame rate desired. 10 fps looks 
      fine. Most Japanese animation has been animated at 8 fps for years...a 
      method known as animating "on threes", as each drawing is shot 3 times, 
      producing 8 frames per second.
      <P>I'm starting to bore myself, and that takes some doing.
