<h1>Thinking Inside the Box</h1>
<p class="description">When you are styling a web page with CSS page you must start to think in terms of <b>boxes</b>.</p>
<p>Each element is treated as if it generates a new box. Each box can have new rules associated with it.</p>
<img src="images/boxmodel.gif" alt="How CSS treats a box" />
<p>As you can see from the diagram above, each box has a <b>border</b>. Between the content and the border you can have <b>padding</b>, and outside of the border you can have a <b>margin</b> to separate this box from any neighboring boxes. </p>
