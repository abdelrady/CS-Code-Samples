<H3><A name=blankpage></A>When I try to load your page on my browser, it shows 
up as a blank page or some of the information is missing. What do I do?</H3>

your Web browser. You may do this by the following:</P>
<P>In Netscape 4.5:</P>

<H3><A name=concepts></A>What is a "Concept" and why is it better than a 
keyword?</H3>
<P>Concept searches can match different words with similar meanings. Keyword 
searches produce only exact word matching. Concept searching allows candidates 
and employers to find each other even if they use different words with similar 
meanings. Keyword searches may not accurately match jobs to candidates because 
an employer used a synonym of a keyword that exists in a candidate's 
profile.<BR></P>
