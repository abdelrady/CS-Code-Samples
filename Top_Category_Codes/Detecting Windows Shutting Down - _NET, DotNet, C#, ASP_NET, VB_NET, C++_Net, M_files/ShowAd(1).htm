<BODY><FONT face=arial size=2>Ouch, you are hurting our servers!<BR><BR>You were 
hitting the site from your IP Address of 62.139.40.253 at a rate faster than 
comprehensible by a human at 72 hits per minute for 47 minutes. If allowed to 
continue, it would cause our servers to crash and be unavailable to other users. 
Please slow it down!<BR><BR>Some causes of this problem are:<BR><BR>1) Using a 
download accelerator program (such as Download Accelerator) or automated 
retrieval program (such as 'Get Right'). These programs may speed up access to 
small sites, but on large sites like this one, with so many people trying to use 
them, they cause server outages.<BR>2) Turning off caching in your browser 
(which causes it reload every image on every page...taxing the servers)<BR>3) 
Plain old browsing too quickly...<BR><BR>If this is your first warning...this 
page will disappear in 24 hours. Users who continue to violate this rule will be 
permanently banned from the site. Thanks for your cooperation in keeping the 
site available for everyone.<BR><BR>User info: id# 48527 - 62.139.40.253 on
