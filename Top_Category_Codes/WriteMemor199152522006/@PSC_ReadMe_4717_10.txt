Title: WriteMemoryProcess Function
Description: Ive spent hours looking and now ive finally solved how to declare WriteMemoryProcess in VB .Net. Sorry for the short snappy code. The aim of this code is to change a value of a processes memory using a given memory offset. To get the process you need to specify the window text tho :). You should also find the comments quite useful ^^.
