Simple little console app which locks files by
opening them exclusively and so prevents malicious
applications from deleting/editing them.

Nothing fancy, I just wrote it for myself since
I'm a bit paranoid and afraid of rootkits.

Commands:
secure [physical path to file] - Secures the specified file
unsecure [physical path to file] - Unlocks it for write access
list - Lists all secured files
save - Saves list of secured files. Will be secured automatically
       on restart.
load - Manually loads list of secured files.
exit - Unsecures, saves and quits.
