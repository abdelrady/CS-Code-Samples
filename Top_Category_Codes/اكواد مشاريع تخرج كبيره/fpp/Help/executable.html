You can even make an executable from you algorithm. Select <B>"Make Executable"</B>
from <B>"File"</B> menu. Enter full path name for your algoritm.<BR><BR>


The system does not generates a real executable, it just
copies the program file and creates a special <B>".INI"</B> file that is used
to load and run the program without showing the flow. All functions that are used
in your program should be copied to the same folder when the executable file is.

<BR><BR>

Usually, executable file is created for programs that have some other use
except just showing the algorithms, for example <B>"d.fpp"</B> in examples -
it is an image mapper for the web pages. It requires these files to be copied
to the same folder where the executable (.exe file) is:<BR>
<B>D.fpp</B> - main algorithm with window.<BR>

<B>D0.fpp</B> ... <B>D6.fpp</B>  - seven functions that are called as events by the main window (D.fpp).

Happy coding!
