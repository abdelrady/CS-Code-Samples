Title: DataEasy: Connect to MS Access (.mdb) Files Easily using C#
Description: DataEasy: is an application written in C# which would allow the user to load any Microsoft Access file (file format '.mdb'). This application uses OleDb as a backhand communicator with the file to allow the user to : select, delete, insert and modify the database and then save all the changes to the original file. Along with the Data Grid control TextBoxs and Labels are generated automatically and dynamically at run time to allow easy and efficient data input according to the data in the .mdb file loaded. If the file has more than one table in its database, a combobox in the application will allow the user to choose which table to work on. By right clicking column headers who’s data type is either ‘integer’ or ‘DateTime’ the user can opt for either inserting Automatic numbering based on previous cell’s value incremented by 1 or insert that day’s date automatically in their respective column on adding new data. Also provided a Search and Filter capability, by right clicking the search form’s column headers the user can filter in the element (of the column clicked) he\she wants to view. Multiple filtering can be done by filtering more than one column. The user can also use a simple search, by typing in the search textbox to find data in the database. I have included a database file ‘textbooks.mdb’ file with the application so you can try the program. I hope this program will be useful in learning how to load and modify databases and link to ‘mdb’ files, your voting will be appreciated :).
