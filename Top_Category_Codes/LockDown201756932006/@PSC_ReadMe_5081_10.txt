Title: LockDown
Description: A screen lock program written entirely in vb. I didn't want to use C++ and go the gina route. hopefully i can update this later with mouse hooking in a later release of vb.net
Does a pretty good job for my first attempt at a program of this type.
My biggest .net app to date, was planning to submit in July but have been on vacation and school has just started up
