PROGRAM OVERVIEW

LockDown is a simple screen lock for your PC. I decided to create it after using a free trial of another Screen Lock program. After the trial was finished I figured I could create the same thing free of charge.

If this is your first time running this application then you will be prompted to create a password.
You can hide this program in the system tray when not in use.

If an invalid password was tried on LockDown, then you will be prompted with the time of attempt and invalid password upon unlocking your computer.

You will also be given the option to change the color of your Lock Screen.
