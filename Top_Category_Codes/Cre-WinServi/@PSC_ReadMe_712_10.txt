Title: How to create Windows Services with VB.net (fully commented)
Description: This Programm shows how quickly you can create a Windows Service in VB.NET, actually this service monitors all the changes made to your WINNT Directory, also checks the OS, this Service should help you to monitor your WINNT or Windows Directory when you install new software so you can see which new files where installed (ocx, dll) and which files where changed or deleted. Nearly every line of the code is commented, on top of the Service1.vb File you will find a short instruction how to install and run the Service.
