Title: FileBurner
Description: FileBurner is a program that will (hopefully) delete files more completely than the default recycle bin. Drag and drop a file or multiple files (not folders, I haven't added that feature yet) onto the exe file. It will then give you a confirmation box. The program then fills the file with null values and deletes it. If all works well, it should not be able to be restored. 
This is my first submission to this site, and its really just to get feedback about my code. I would really appreciate if you could review this code to make sure there are no mistakes. If anyone wants to try and use any software they have, or other methods, to restore the file, I would greatly appreciate if you told me of this and I could try and correct it.
