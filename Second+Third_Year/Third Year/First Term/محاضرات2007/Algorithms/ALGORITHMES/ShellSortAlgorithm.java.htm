 *
 * Shellsort is a simple extension of insertion sort which gains speed
 * by allowing exchanges of elements that are far apart. The idea is
 * to rearrange the array to give it the property that every hth
 * element (starting anywhere) yields a sorted array. Such an array
 * is said to be h-sorted.
 *
 * By h-sorting for some large values of h, we can move elements in
 * the array long distances and thus make it easier to h-sort for
 * smaller values of h. Using such a procedure for any sequence of
 * values h which ends in 1 will produce a sorted array.
