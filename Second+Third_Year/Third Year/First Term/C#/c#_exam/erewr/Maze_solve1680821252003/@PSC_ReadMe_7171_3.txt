Title: Maze solver using backtacking & recursion
Description: The following code shows how to solve a maze using recursion and backtracking. Which attempt to complete a search for a solution to a problem by constructing partial solutions, always ensuring that the partial solutions remain consistent with the requirements of the problem. The algorithm then attempts to extend a partial solution toward completion, but when an inconsistency with the requirements of the problem occurs, the algorithm backs up (backtracks) by removing the most recently constructed part of the solution and trying another possibility.
