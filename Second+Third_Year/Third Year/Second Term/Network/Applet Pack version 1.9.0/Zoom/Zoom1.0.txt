Special Notes:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* The images have any size you want.

* The animation is suspended when you click, it's resumed when
  you click again.

* The background color format is hexadecimal format like this :
  blue is "#0000ff"", red is "#ff0000" ... If you want that the
  background color is the same as the one of the page, look at the
  html source file and find the balise : <body bgcolor="#00FFFF">
  Then copy the value, here it's "#00ffff".
