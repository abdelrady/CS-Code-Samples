    <h1>COSC 78 Homework 4</h1>

    <hr>

    <p>Each homework in this course will be taken from textbook questions.

<h3> Chapter 4 Problems </h3>
<ol>
	<li><b>Chapter 4 Problem 1. </b>
<p>
Consider some of the pros and cons of virtual-circuit and datagram networks.
<ol type="a">

<li>Suppose that in the network layer, routers were subject to stressful conditions that might cause them to fail fairly often. At a high level, what actions would need to be taken on such router failure? Does this argue in favor of VC or datagram architecture?</li>
<li> Suppose that in order to provide a guarantee regarding the level of performance (for example, delay) that would be seen along a source-to-destination path, the network requires a sender to declare its peak traffic rate. If the declared peak traffic rate and the existing declared traffic rates are such that there is no way to get traffic from source to the destination that meets the required delay requirements, the source is not allowed access to the network. Would such an approach be more easily accomplished within a VC or a datagram architecture? </li>
</ol>
<p>
  	<li><b>Chapter 4 Problem 2. </b>
<p>
Consider a virtual-circuit network. Suppose the VC number is a 16-bit field.
<ol type="a">

<li>What is the maximum number of virtual circuits that can be carried over the link?</li>
<li> Suppose a central node determines paths and VC numbers at connection setup. Suppose the same VC number is used on each link along the VC's path. Describe how the central node might determine the VC number at connection setup. Is it possible that there are fewer VCs in progress than the maximum in (a) yet there is no common free VC number?</li>
<li>Suppose that different VC numbers are permitted in each link along a VC's path. During connection setup, after end-to-end path is determined, describe how the links can choose their VC numbers and configure their forwarding tables in decentralized manner, without reliance on a central node.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	<li><b>Chapter 4 Problem 4.</b>
  Consider a VC network with a 2-bit field for the VC number.
Suppose that the network wants to set up a virtual circuit over
four links: link A, link B, link C, and link D.
Suppose that each of these links is currently carrying two other
virtual circuits, and the VC numbers of these other
VCs are as follows:
<TABLE border=1 align=center>
<TR><TD align=center>Link A</TD>
   <TD align=center>Link B</TD>
   <TD align=center>Link C</TD>

   <TD align=center>Link D</TD></TR>
<TR><TD align=center>00<BR>01</TD>
   <TD align=center>01<BR>10</TD>
   <TD align=center>10<BR>11</TD>
   <TD align=center>11<BR>00</TD></TR>

</TABLE>
In answering the following questions, keep in mind that each of
the existing VCs may only traverse one of the four links.
   <ol type='a'>
      <li>If each VC is required to use the same VC number
         on all links along its path, what VC number could be
         assigned to the new VC?</li>
      <li>If each VC is permitted to have different VC numbers
         in the different links along its path (so that the forwarding
         table must perform VC number translation), how many
         different combinations of four VC numbers (one for each
         of the four links) could be used?</li>
   </ol>
</li>
<li><b> Chapter 4 Problem 7.</b>
Consider a datagram network using 32-bit host addresses.  Suppose
a router has four links, numbered 0 through 3, and packets are
to be forwarded to the link interfaces as follows:
<table border=1 align=center>

<TR><TH align=center>Destination Address Range</TH>
   <TH align=center>Link Interface</TH></TR>
<TR><TD align=center>11100000 00000000 00000000 00000000<BR>
                        through<BR>
                     11100000 11111111 11111111 11111111</TD>
   <TD align=center>0</TD></TR>
<TR><TD align=center>11100001 00000000 00000000 00000000<BR>

                        through<BR>
                     11100001 00000000 11111111 11111111</TD>
   <TD align=center>1</TD></TR>
<TR><TD align=center>11100001 00000001 00000000 00000000<BR>
                        through<BR>
                     11100001 11111111 11111111 11111111</TD>

   <TD align=center>2</TD></TR>
<TR><TD align=center>otherwise</TD>
   <TD align=center>3</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
   <ol type='a'>
      <li>Provide a forwarding table that has four entries,
         uses longest-prefix matching, and forwards packets to
         the correct link interfaces</li>
      <li>Describe how your forwarding table determines the
         appropriate link interface for datagrams with
         destination addresses:<BR>

         <CENTER>
            11001000 10010001 01010001 01010101<BR>

            11100001 10000000 00010001 01110111</CENTER></li>
   </ol>
</li>
<li><b> Chapter 4 Problem 8.</b>
Consider a datagram network using 8-bit host addresses. Suppose a router uses longest prefix matching and has t he following forwarding table:
<TABLE border=1 align=center>
<TR><TD align=center>Prefix Match</TD>
   <TD align=center>Interface</TD>
  
<TR><TD align=center>00</td><td>0</TD>
  <tr> <TD align=center>01</td><td>1</TD></tr>
<tr>
   <TD align=center>10</td><td>2</TD></tr>
  <tr> <TD align=center>11</td><td>3</TD></TR>

</TABLE>
For each of the four interfaces, give the associated range of destination host addresses and the number of addresses in the range. 
<li><b> Chapter 4 Problem 9.</b>

<TABLE border=1 align=center>
<TR><TD align=center>Prefix Match</TD>
   <TD align=center>Interface</TD>
  
<TR><TD align=center>1</td><td>0</TD></tr>
  <tr> <TD align=center>11</td><td>1</TD></tr>
<tr>
   <TD align=center>111</td><td>2</TD></tr>
  <tr> <TD align=center>otherwise</td><td>3</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
For each of the four interfaces, give the associated range of destination host addresses and the number of addresses in the range. 
     <li><b>Chapter 4 Problem 14.</b>
        <p>
Consider the topology shown in Figure 4.17. Denote the three subnets with hosts (starting clockwise at 12:00) as Networks A,B and C. Denote the subnets without hosts as Networks D,E,F.
<ol type="a">

<li>Assign network addresses to each of these six subnets, with the following constraints: All addresses must be allocated from 214.97.254/17; Subnet A should have enough addresses to support 250 interfaces; Subnet B should have enough addresses to support 120 interfaces; and Subnet C should have enough addresses to support 120 interfaces. Of course, subnets D,E,F should each be able to support two interfaces. For each subnet, the assignment should take the form a.b.c.d/x or a.b.c.d/x - e.f.g.h/y.</li>
<li> Using your answer to part (a), provide the forwarding tables (using longest prefix matching) for each of the three routers.<li>
</ol>

<ol type="a">

<li>Assign addresses to all interfaces in the home network.</li>
<li> Suppose each host has two ongoing TCP connections, all to port 80 at host 128.119.40.86. Provide the six corresponding entries in the NAT translation table.</li>
