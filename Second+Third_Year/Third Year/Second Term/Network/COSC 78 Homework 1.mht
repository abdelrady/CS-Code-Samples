<HR>

<P>Each homework in this course will be taken from textbook questions.=20
<H3>Chapter 1 Review Questions </H3>
<OL>
  <LI><B>Chapter 1 Review Question 2.</B>=20
  <P>The word <I>protocol</I> is often used to describe diplomatic =
relations.=20
  Give an example of a diplomatic protocol.</P>
  <LI><B>Chapter 1 Review Question 6.</B>=20
  <P>Provide a brief, high-level description of how the Internet's=20
  connection-oriented service provides reliable transport.</P>
  <LI><B>Chapter 1 Review Question 8.</B>=20
  <P>Why is it said that packet switching employs statistical =
multiplexing?=20
  Contrast statistical multiplexing with multiplexing that takes place =
in=20
  TDM.</P></LI></OL>
<H3>Chapter 1 Problems </H3>
<OL>
  <LI><B>Chapter 1 Problem 2. </B>
  <P>Review the car-caravan analogy in Section 1.6. Again assume a =
propagation=20
  speed of 100 km/hour, and that each toll booth transmits (services) a =
car at a=20
  rate of 5 cars/minute (one car every 12 seconds). </P>
  <OL type=3Da>
    <LI>Suppose the caravan travels 200 km, beginning in front of one =
toll=20
    booth, passing through a second toll booth, and finishing just =
before a=20
    third toll booth. What is the end-to-end delay?=20
    <LI>Repeat (a), now assuming that there are seven cars in the =
caravan=20
    instead of 10. </LI></OL>
  <P></P>
  <LI><B>Chapter 1 Problem 5.</B>=20
  <P>Consider sending a packet of <I>F</I> bits over a path of <I>Q</I> =
links.=20
  Each link transmits at <I>R</I> bps. The network is lightly loaded so =
that=20
  there are no queuing delays. Propagation delay is negligible. </P>
  <OL type=3Da>
    <LI>Suppose the network is a packet-switched virtual-circuit =
network. Denote=20
    the VC setup time by <I>t<SUB>s</SUB></I> seconds. Suppose the =
sending=20
    layers add a total of <I>h</I> bits of header to the packet. How =
long does=20
    it take to send the file from source to destination?=20
    <LI>Suppose the network is a packet-switched datagram network and a=20
    connectionless service is used. Now suppose each packet has =
<I>2h</I> bits=20
    of header. How long does it take to send the packet?=20
    <LI>Finally, suppose that the network is a circuit-switched network. =
Further=20
    suppose that the transmission rate of the circuit between source and =

    destination is <I>R</I> bps. Assuming <I>t<SUB>s</SUB></I> setup =
time and=20
    <I>h</I> bits of header appended to the packet, how long does it =
take to=20
    send the packet? </LI></OL>
  <P></P>
  <LI><B>Chapter 1 Problem 13.</B>=20
  <P>Perform a traceroute between a host machine within the cs =
department and=20
  two destination hosts. One located in the US and the other located in =
New=20
  Zealand. Do this for each of the two combinations at three different =
hours of=20
  the day. Any end hosts located in each country will do but suggested =
hosts in=20
  New Zealand are <EM>byerley.cs.waikato.ac.nz</EM> or=20
  <EM>wand.cs.waikato.ac.nz</EM> and suggested end hosts in the US would =
be=20
  <EM>infolabwebservices.stanford.edu</EM> or =
<EM>dwight.cs.berkeley.edu</EM>.=20
  Refer to the man page for traceroute, and the appropriate section of =
Chapter 1=20
  of the course text for more information. </P>
  <OL type=3Da>
    <LI>Provide the results from your traceroute experiments. You should =
use the=20
    script command to capture this output.=20
    <LI>Find the number of routers in the path at each of the three =
hours. Did=20
    the paths change during any of the hours? If so, provide an example =
of such=20
    a change from your traceroute logs.=20
    <LI>Try to identify the number of ISP networks that the traceroute =
packets=20
    pass through from source to destination. Routers with similar names =
and/or=20
    similar IP addresses should be considered as part of the same ISP. =
In your=20
    experiments, do the largest delays occur at the interfaces between =
adjacent=20
    ISPs?=20
    <LI>Repeat the above for a source and destination on different =
continents.=20
    Compare the intra-continent and inter-continent results.=20
