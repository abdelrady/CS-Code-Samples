    <h1>COSC 78 Homework 5</h1>

    <hr>

    <p>Each homework in this course will be taken from textbook questions.

<h3> Chapter 4 Problems </h3>
<ol>
	<li><b>Chapter 4 Problem 18. </b>
In this problem we will explore the impact of NATs on
P2P applications1 . Suppose a peer with user name Arnold discovers through querying that a
peer with user name Bernard has a ﬁle it wants to download. Also suppose that Bernard is
behind a NAT whereas Arnold isn’t. Let 138.76.29.7 be the WAN-side address of the NAT and
let 10.0.0.1 be the internal IP address for Bernard. Assume that the NAT is not speciﬁcally
conﬁgured for the P2P application.
   <ol type='a'>
      <li>Discuss why Arnold’s peer cannot initiate a TCP connection to Bernard’s peer, even if
     Arnold knows the WAN’s side address of the NAT, 138.76.29.7</li>
      <li>Now suppose that Bernard has established an ongoing TCP connection to another peer,
     Cindy, which is not behind a NAT. Also suppose that Arnold learned from Cindy that
     Bernard has the desired ﬁle and that Arnold can establish (or already has established) a
     TCP connection with Cindy. Describe how Arnold can use these two TCP connections
     (one from Bernard to Cindy, and the other from Arnold to Cindy) to instruct Bernard
     to initiate a direct TCP connection (that is, not passing through Cindy) back to Arnold.
     This technique is sometimes called connection reversal. Note that even though Bernard is
     behind a NAT, Arnold can use this direct TCP connection to request the ﬁle, and Bernard
     can use the connection to deliver the ﬁle.</li>

  	<li><b>Chapter 4 Problem 21. </b>
<p>
Consider the network depicted on page 408 (upper part of the page) in the Kurose and Ross text book. With the indicated link costs, use Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm to compute the shortest path from x to all network nodes. Show how the algorithm works by computing a table similar to Table 4.3 (also in the Kurose and Ross text book). 
	<li><b>Chapter 4 Problem 24.</b>
 Consider a general topology (that is, not the specific network shown above) and a syncronous version of the distance vector algorithm. Suppose that at each iteration, a node exchanges its distance vectors with its neighbors and receives their distance vectors. Assuming that the algorithm begins with each node knowing only the costs to its immediate neighbors, what is the maximum number of iterations required before the distributed algorithm coverges? Justify your answer.
</li>
<li><b> Chapter 4 Problem 28.</b>
Consider the following network. ISP B provides national backbone service to regional ISP A. ISP C provides national backbone service to regional ISP D. B and C peer with each other in two places using BGP. Consider traffic going from A to D. B would prefer to hand that traffic over to C on the West Coast (so that C would have to absorb the cost of carrying the traffic cross-country), while C would prefer to get the traffic via its East Coast peering point with B (so that B would have carried the traffic accross the country). What BGP mechanism might C use, so that B would hand over A-to-D traffic at their East Coast peering point? To answer this question, you will need to dig into the BGP specification. (to assist with this question you may wish to consult the diagram on pg 410 of the Kurose and Ross text book)
