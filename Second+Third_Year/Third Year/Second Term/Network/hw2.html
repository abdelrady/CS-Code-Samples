    <hr>

    <p>Each homework in this course will be taken from textbook questions.

<h3> Chapter 2 Problems </h3>
<ol>
	<li><b>Chapter 2 Problem 5. </b>
<p>
Obtain the HTTP/1.1 sepcification (RFC 2616). Answer the following questions:
<ol type="a">

<li>Explain the mechanism used for signaling between the client and the server to indicate that a persistent connection is being closed. Can the client, the server, or both signal the close of a connection?</li>
<li> What encryption services are provided by HTTP? </li>
</ol>
<p>
        <li><b>Chapter 2 Problem 6.</b>
        <p>
Suppose within your Web browser you click on a link to obtain a Web page. Suppose that the IP address for the associated URL is not cached in your local host, so that a DNS look-up is necessary to obtain the IP address. Suppose that n DNS servers are visited before your host receives the IP address from DNS; the successive visits incur RTTs of RTT1, . . . , RTTn. Further suppose that the Web page associated with the link contains exactly one object, a small amount of HTML text. Let RTT0 denote the RTT between the local host and the server containing the object. Assuming zero transmission time of the object, how much time elapses from when the client clicks on the link until the client receives the object? 

<p>
	<li><b>Chapter 2 Problem 7.</b>
           <p>  Referring to Problem 6, suppose the HTML file references three very small objects on the same server. Neglecting transmission times, how much time elapses with:
 
<ol type="a">
   <li>Nonpersistent HTTP with no parallel TCP connections?
       </li>
   <li>Nonpersistent HTTP with parallel connections?
       </li>
   <li>Persistent HTTP with pipelining? 
</ol>
<p>
<li><b> Chapter 2 Problem 9.</b>
Consider Figure 2.11, for which there is an institutional network connected to the Internet. Suppose that the average object size is 900,000 bits and that the average request rate from the institution's browsers to the origin servers in 1.5 requests per second. Also suppose that the amount of time it takes from when the router on the Internet side of the access link forwards an HTTP request until it receives the response is two seconds on average (see Section 2.2.6). Model the total average response time as the sum of the average access delay (that is, the delay from Internet router to institution router) and the average Internet delay. For the average access delay, use Δ/(1-Δβ), where Δ is the average time required to send an object over the access link and β is the arrival rate of objects to the access link.
<ol type="a">
   <li>Find the total average response time.</li>
   <li>Now suppose a cache is installed in the institutional LAN. Suppose the hit rate is 0.4. Find the total response time.
</ol>
<p>
<li><b> Chapter 2 Problem 13.</b>
<ol type="a">
<li>What is a whois database?

<li>Use various whois databases on the Internet to obtain the names of two DNS servers. Indicate which whois database you used.

<li>Use nslookup on your local host to send DNS queries to three DNS servers: your local DNS server and the two DNS servers you found in part(b). Try querying for type A, NS, MX reports. Summarize your finding.

<li>Use ARIN whois database to determine the IP address range used by your university.

<li>Describe how an attacker can use whois databases and nslookup tool perform reconnaissance on an institution before launching an attack.

<li>Discuss why whois database should be publicly available. 
</ol>

<li><b> Chapter 2 Problem 17.</b>
In this problem we explore the reverse-path routing of the QueryHit messages in Gnutella. Suppose that Alice issues a Query message. Further suppose that Bob receives the Query messages (which may have been forwarded by several intermediate peers) and has a file that matches the query.
<ol type="a">
   <li> Recall that when a peer has a matching file, it sends a QueryHit message along the reverse path of the corresponding Query message. An alternative design would be for Bob to establish a direct TCP connection with Alice and send the QueryHit message over this connection. What are the advantages and disadvantages of such an alternative design?
   <li> In the Gnutella protocol, when the peer Alice generates a Query message, it inserts a unique ID in the message’s MessageID field. When the peer Bob has a match, it generates QueryHit message using the same MessageID as the Query message. Describe how peers can use the MessageID field and local routing tables to accomplish reverse-path routing.
   <li> An alternative approach, which does not use message identifiers, is as follows. When a query message reaches a peer, before forwarding the message, the peer augments the query message with its IP address. Describe how peers can use this mechanism to accomplish reverse-path routing.
</ol>
