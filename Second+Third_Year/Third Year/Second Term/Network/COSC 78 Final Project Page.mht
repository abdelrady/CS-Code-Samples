<H3>Project Suggestions</H3>
<UL type=3Dsquare>
  <LI><B>Network Application with Load Balancing:</B> Develop a =
client/server=20
  network based application but with the focus of the project being to =
implement=20
  a load balancing mechanism so that client requests are distributed =
between=20
  multiple servers. To keep this simple you may implement an application =
that=20
  will not require state to be synchronized between the servers. You =
should=20
  demonstrate the value in the distribution of requests accross multiple =

  machines, perhaps by showing that the number of clients supported can =
be=20
  increased as the number of servers is increased.=20
  <LI><B>P2P Instant Messenger: </B>Develop a peer to peer instant =
messenger=20
  system that allows basic communications, exchange files and so on. =
Some=20
  additional features would be a GUI, voice support, encryption.=20
  <LI><B>Network Application with Fault Tolerance:</B> Similar in =
approach to=20
  the first suggested project in that the actual application is of =
secondary=20
  importance. The focus of this project would be implement a network =
application=20
  that would have requirements of high availability, such as an online =
store.=20
  Develop the server side software such that state for the application =
is=20
  distributed seamlessly across multiple servers so that the failure of =
any=20
  individual machine incurs a minimal amount of down time.=20
  <LI><B>Software VCR:</B> A number of sources of video/audio on the =
Internet=20
  are available only as a stream. As a consequence many of them can not =
be saved=20
  as a file for subsequenct offline replay. In theory a simple method to =

  circumvent this would be to capture the trace of the streamed packets =
and=20
  'replay' in such a way the streaming client believes this stream is =
actually=20
  occurring live. A project would be to find a form of streaming media =
and=20
  develop the tools to record and replay these streams. Some streaming =
protocols=20
  maybe resistant to such approaches. One challenge to this project will =
be=20
  finding forms of streaming media for which this approach is =
applicable.=20
  Perhaps the Dartmouth College networked based streaming television =
service=20
  would make an interesting test case.=20
  <LI><B>Streaming Song Server and Client: </B>Develop server and client =

  applications to stream music over a network connection. Interesting =
extensions=20
  to this idea would be the support of already defined protocols or =
integration=20
  of existing Internet services such as CDDB. </LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
