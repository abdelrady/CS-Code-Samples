<H1>Error Codes</H1>

<P>The <B>error codes</B> are values that identify different types of errors in the Windows API.  Most functions do not report the error code directly; instead, they simply return a flag specifying if some error occured or not.  The actual error code can usually be obtained by using the <A href="getlasterror.html" tppabs="http://www.vbapi.com/ref/g/getlasterror.html">GetLastError</A> function.</P>

<P>The following list identifies various error codes defined in the Windows API.  Your application may define its own error codes and use them with the <A href="funcc.html#errors" tppabs="http://www.vbapi.com/ref/funcc.html#errors">error functions</A>.  However, make sure that bit 29 (&amp;H20000000) is set in any application-defined error code you define.  Because no Windows API-defined error code has that bit set, using that bit assures that your error code will not conflict with an existing one.</P>
