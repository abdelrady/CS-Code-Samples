<H1>Winsock Error Codes</H1>

<P>The following list identifies the Winsock error codes.  These values are used by the <A href="wsagetlasterror.html" tppabs="http://www.vbapi.com/ref/w/wsagetlasterror.html">WSAGetLastError</A> function to report and identify errors caused by other Winsock functions.</P>

<P>The following Winsock error codes are listed in ascending numerical order.</P>

<P><DL>
<DT>WSAEINTR (10004)<DD>Interrupted Function Call -- A blocking operation was cancelled.
<DT>WSAEACCESS (10013)<DD>Permission Denied -- An attempt to access a socket was forbidden by its access permissions.
<DT>WSAEFAULT (10014)<DD>Bad Address -- An invalid pointer address was specified in a function call.
<DT>WSAEINVAL (10022)<DD>Invalid Argument -- An invalid argument was passed to a function.
<DT>WSAEMFILE (10024)<DD>Too Many Open Files -- There are too many open sockets.
<DT>WSAEWOULDBLOCK (10035)<DD>Resource Temporarily Unavailable -- The specified socket operation cannot be completed immediately, but the operation should be retried later.
<DT>WSAEINPROGRESS (10036)<DD>Operation Now in Progress -- A blocking operation is currently executing.
<DT>WSAEALREADY (10037)<DD>Operation Already in Progress -- An operation was attempted on a non-binding socket that alredy had an operation in progress.
<DT>WSAENOTSOCK (10038)<DD>Socket Operation on Non-Socket -- An operation was attempted on something that is not a socket.
<DT>WSAEDESTADDRREQ (10039)<DD>Destination Address Required -- A required address was omitted from a socket operation.
<DT>WSAEMSGSIZE (10040)<DD>Message Too Long -- A message was sent on a datagram socket that exceeds the internal message buffer or some other limit.
<DT>WSAEPROTOTYPE (10041)<DD>Protocol Wrong Type for Socket -- A protocol was specified that is not supported by the target socket.
<DT>WSAENOPROTOOPT (10042)<DD>Bad Protocol Option -- An unknown, invalid, or unsupported protocol option or leel was specified.
<DT>WSAEPROTONOSUPPORT (10043)<DD>Protocol Not Supported -- The specified protocol is not supported or is not implemented.
<DT>WSAESOCKTNOSUPPORT (10044)<DD>Socket Type Not Supported -- The specified socket type is not supported in the address family.
<DT>WSAEOPNOTSUPP (10045)<DD>Operation Not Supported -- The specified operation is not supported by the referenced object.
<DT>WSAEPFNOSUPPORT (10046)<DD>Protocol Family Not Supported -- The specified protocol family is not supported or is not implemented.
<DT>WSAEAFNOSUPPORT (10047)<DD>Address Family Not Supported by Protocol Family -- An address incompatible with the requested network protocol was used.
<DT>WSAEADDRINUSE (10048)<DD>Address Already in Use -- An attempt to use the same IP address and port with two different sockets simultaneously was made.
<DT>WSAEADDRNOTAVAIL (10049)<DD>Cannot Assign Requested Address -- The requested address is not valid (given the context of the function).
<DT>WSAENETDOWN (10050)<DD>Network is Down -- A socket operation encountered a network that is down.
<DT>WSAENETUNREACH (10051)<DD>Network is Unreachable -- A socket operation encountered an unreachable network.
<DT>WSAENETRESET (10052)<DD>Network Dropped Connection on Reset -- A connection was broken due to "keep-alive" activity detecting a failure.
<DT>WSAECONNABORTED (10053)<DD>Software Caused Connection Abort -- A connection was aborted by software on the host computer.
<DT>WSAECONNRESET (10054)<DD>Connection Reset by Peer -- A connection was forcibly closed by the remote host.
<DT>WSAENOBUFS (10055)<DD>No Buffer Space Available -- A socket operation could not be performed because the system ran out of buffer space or the queue was full.
<DT>WSAEISCONN (10056)<DD>Socket is Already Connected -- A connect request was made on a socket that is already connected.
<DT>WSAENOTCONN (10057)<DD>Socket is Not Connected -- An attempt to send or receive data failed because the socket is not connected.
<DT>WSAESHUTDOWN (10058)<DD>Cannot Send After Socket Shutdown -- An attempt to send or receive data failed because the socket has already been shut down.
<DT>WSAETIMEDOUT (10060)<DD>Connection Timed Out -- The remote host failed to respond within the timeout period.
<DT>WSAECONNREFUSED (10061)<DD>Connection Refused -- The target machine actively refused the attempt to connect to it.
<DT>WSAEHOSTDOWN (10064)<DD>Host is Down -- The destination host is down.
<DT>WSAEHOSTUNREACH (10065)<DD>No Route to Host -- The destination host is unreachable.
<DT>WSAEPROCLIM (10067)<DD>Too Many Processes -- The Winsock implementation has exceeded the number of applications that can use it simultaneously.
<DT>WSASYSNOTREADY (10091)<DD>Network Subsystem is Unavailable -- The underlying system to provide network services is unavailable.
<DT>WSAVERNOTSUPPORTED (10092)<DD>winsock.dll Version Out of Range -- The Winsock implementation does not support the requested Winsock version.
<DT>WSANOTINITIALIZED (10093)<DD>Successful WSAStartup Not Yet Performed -- The calling application has not successfully called <A href="wsastartup.html" tppabs="http://www.vbapi.com/ref/w/wsastartup.html">WSAStartup</A> to initiate a Winsock session.
<DT>WSAEDISCON (10094)<DD>Graceful Shutdown in Progress -- The remote party has initiated a graceful shutdown sequence.
<DT>WSATYPE_NOT_FOUND (10109)<DD>Class Type Not Found -- The specified class was not found.
<DT>WSAHOST_NOT_FOUND (11001)<DD>Host Not Found -- No network host matching the hostname or address was found.
<DT>WSATRY_AGAIN (11002)<DD>Non-Authoritative Host Not Found -- A temporary error while resolving a hostname occured, and should be retried later.
<DT>WSANO_RECOVERY (11003)<DD>This is a Non-Recoverable Error -- Some sort of non-recoverable error occured during a database lookup.
<DT>WSANO_DATA (11004)<DD>Valid Name, No Data Record of Requested Type -- The requested name is valid and was found, but does not have the associated data requested.
