<H1>Windows API Guide</H1>

<P class="center"><BIG>Last Updated: January 21, 2001</BIG></P>

<P>Welcome to the Windows API Guide!  Here, you will discover a wealth of information to help you implement calls to the Windows API directly from your Visual Basic programs.  This site is sort of a work in progress; it falls short of encompassing the entire Windows API.  Nevertheless, new information about functions and the like is added every two or three weeks.  Check back often to see what's new!</P>

<H2><A href="index.html" tppabs="http://www.vbapi.com/ref/index.html">Reference</A></H2>
<P>The <B>Reference</B> section contains documentation on hundreds of Windows API functions.  Besides the functions, information on the related structures and other items also appears for reference.  Each function page includes a well-commented example illustrating common usage of the function.</P>

<H2><A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.vbapi.com/articles/index.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.vbapi.com/articles/index.html'" tppabs="http://www.vbapi.com/articles/index.html">Articles</A></H2>
<P>The <B>Articles</B> section contains articles about API-related topics.  These multi-page articles go in-depth about a specific issue in the API and offer a more well-rounded approach to learning about API functions without much technical information.  Of course, the reference information for each function is only a click away.</P>

<P>Still can't find what you're looking for anywhere on the site?  Then try browsing the <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.vb-world.net/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.vb-world.net/'" tppabs="http://www.vb-world.net/">VB-World.net</A> web site.  Along with their sizable collection of Visual Basic programming information, they also have an <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.vb-world.net/api  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.vb-world.net/api'" tppabs="http://www.vb-world.net/api">API programming section</A> filled with helpful articles, some of which cover ideas not currently discussed on this web site.</P>

<P>Still unable to find what you're looking for?  You might want to <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.vbapi.com/email.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.vbapi.com/email.html'" tppabs="http://www.vbapi.com/email.html">e-mail me</A> about what you're looking for.  If I can't give you the information, I might be able to point you in the right direction anyway.</P>
