      <title>UPDATED: SQL Server 2005 Query Plan Webcast                                                         </title>
      <link>http://www.sqlteam.com/item.asp?ItemID=24228</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, March 22nd at 9:00AM PST I&apos;m going to be presenting a free webcast on SQL Server 2005 query plans.  The session starts very basic.  We start with very simple query plans and work up as far as we can in the 45 minute session.  We&apos;ll also cover profiler and some limited index maintenance.  If you haven&apos;t worked much with query plans this is a great session to get started.
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ad.doubleclick.net/clk;26540591;12550611;w?http://www.learn2asp.net/campaign.aspx&quot;&gt;View the recorded webcast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;The registration web site is a little funky.  Most of these webcasts are targeted at ColdFusion, PHP and Java Developers.  Those are the first three choices on the web page.  If you use one of those you can choose it.  If you don&apos;t use one you can choose any of them.&lt;/p&gt;  
 
&lt;p&gt;On the second page there is a tab for Data Access on the bottom of the page.  My session is listed there.  &lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; The recorded web cast is now available.  You&apos;ll need to register using the procedure I described above.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The PASS Conference in North America is November 14th - 17th, 2006.  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://passew.prod.web.sba.com/callpapers/CallPapers.cfm?conference_id=15&quot;&gt;Call for Speakers&lt;/a&gt; is currently open.  If you&apos;d like to be considered as a speaker you&apos;ll need to submit an abstract (or abstracts) by April 28th, 2006.  (Do it now so you don&apos;t forget!)  PASS is the largest SQL Server conference in the world.  It&apos;s a great experience and I heartily recommend it.  Of course, I am on the Board of Directors.  Anyway, I&apos;m looking forward to attending the conference and meeting as many of you as possible.</description>

      <title>Counting Parents and Children with Count Distinct                                                   </title>

      <description>The aggregate functions in SQL Server (min, max, sum, count, average, etc.) are great tools for reporting and business analysis.  But sometimes, you need to tweak them just a little bit to get exactly the results you need.  For example, if your manager came to you and asked for a report on how many sales have been made to your clients and how large they were, would you know how to get the data you need efficiently?  Mark ran into something like this recently and here&apos;s the approach he took to solve the problem.</description>

      <title>Scripting Database Objects using SMO (Updated)                                                      </title>
      <link>http://www.sqlteam.com/item.asp?ItemID=23185</link>
      <description>With the introduction of SQL Server 2005, Microsoft has created a new .NET management API for SQL Server called SQL Management Objects (SMO).  As I started working with SQL Server in earnest following its release I discovered a few limitations that I hoped to correct using SMO.  This article describes those problems and how to use SMO to script database objects.  &lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;: Euan&apos;s post in the comments for this article pointed me a to a feature of SMO that dramatically increases the performance of enumerating objects in the database.  I&apos;ve updated the article and my sample code accordingly.</description>

      <title>Presentation: What I Wish Developers Knew About SQL Server                                          </title>
      <link>http://www.sqlteam.com/item.asp?ItemID=23162</link>
      <description>My apologies for taking so long to post this.  I&apos;ve finally uploaded the PowerPoint slides from &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/downloads/s227.zip&quot;&gt;What I Wish Developers Knew About SQL Server&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;  I presented this at PASS 2005 in Dallas, the Kansas City SQL Server Users Group, the Kansas City .NET SIG, a couple of clients and any other group I could find that would listen to it.  All the deliveries really helped make the PASS presentation smooth and polished.  Thanks to all that attended.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Management Views                                                                            </title>

      <description>The dynamic management views (DMVs) in SQL Server 2005 are designed to give you a window into what&apos;s going on inside SQL Server.  They can provide information on what&apos;s currently happening inside the server as well as the objects it&apos;s storing.  They are designed to be used instead of system tables and the various functions provided in SQL Server 2000.  This article provides an introduction to DMVs and covers a few of the basic views and functions.</description>

      <description>I recently received an email from Roberto Farah who works at Microsoft&apos;s PSS.  Roberto is the co-author of a tool called &lt;a href=&quot;/downloads/sherlock13.zip&quot;&gt;Sherlock&lt;/a&gt; that helps analyze blocking problems in SQL Server.  It pulls together the information from &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;271509&quot;&gt;sp_blocker_pss80&lt;/a&gt; and provides it in an easy to read format.  The download includes the program and a short PowerPoint presentation explaining its use.  I&apos;ll post additional information after I&apos;ve had a chance to work more with it tomorrow.  (This is a .NET application.)  &lt;b&gt;Thanks Roberto!&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;I&gt;UPDATE: The download has been updated to version 1.3 to fix a minor problem.&lt;/I&gt;</description>

      <description>Slava Oks has written a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.msdn.com/slavao/articles/441058.aspx&quot;&gt;very interesting article on SQLOS&lt;/a&gt;.  It&apos;s basically an abstraction layer between the hardware/OS and SQL Server.  This is pretty big architectural change for SQL Server and definitely worth a read.</description>

      <description>The fifth anniversary of SQLTeam.com passed quietly last month.  It was over five years ago that I posted a few paragraphs on &lt;a href=&quot;/item.asp?ItemID=102&quot;&gt;Identity Columns&lt;/a&gt; and called it an &quot;article&quot;.  After the first year I put up an article that talked about how &lt;a href=&quot;/item.asp?ItemID=4592&quot;&gt;SQLTeam.com started&lt;/a&gt;.  This year I want to say Thank You.</description>

      <description>In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sqlteam.com/item.asp?ItemID=21927&quot;&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt; I covered a simple stored procedure that printed the current date.  In this article I&apos;ll cover writing a stored procedure to return a recordset back to the client.  In the process we&apos;ll learn a little bit more about .NET and C# including the SqlConnection, SqlCommand and SqlDataReader classes.</description>

      <title>Writing CLR Stored Procedures in C# - Introduction to C# (Part 1)                                   </title>
      <link>http://www.sqlteam.com/item.asp?ItemID=21927</link>
      <description>This is the first article in a series on writing stored procedures using the Common Language Runtime (CLR).  This article focuses on basic C# syntax and using Visual Studio to build a stored procedure.  It&apos;s targeted at DBA&apos;s and anyone else who primarily writes in Transact-SQL and hasn&apos;t had much exposure to .NET yet.  (Update: Fixed the title.)</description>

      <title>Using CROSS APPLY in SQL Server 2005                                                                </title>
      <link>http://www.sqlteam.com/item.asp?ItemID=21502</link>
      <description>My interest in writing this article was started by an MSDN article titled &lt;a href=&quot;http://msdn.microsoft.com/SQL/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnreal/html/realworld03112005.asp&quot;&gt;SQL Server 2005: The CLR Enters the Relational Stage&lt;/a&gt;.  The article shows how to write a function that returns the top three countries per category.  That&apos;s always been something that was difficult to do in SQL so I was curious about the approach.  The article started out well but I was very unhappy by the end.  It&apos;s just soooo much easier to do this in SQL Server 2005 using the new CROSS APPLY clause in Transact-SQL.  So I&apos;m going to write a query to return the top 3 orders for each customer and I&apos;m going to do it in about 10 lines of SQL.  (&lt;i&gt;UPDATE: An alert reader found an even better approach!&lt;/i&gt;)</description>

      <title>April CTP (aka Beta 3) Available Today                                                              </title>
      <link>http://www.sqlteam.com/item.asp?ItemID=21001</link>
      <description>Microsoft is announcing this morning that the feature complete April Community Technology Preview (CTP) will be available for download today.  They are also announcing that they are releasing this instead of Beta 3.  They plan to continue to release CTP&apos;s until SQL Server 2005 ships.

&lt;P&gt;Microsoft is also announcing a &quot;Go Live&quot; license for the Express Edition of SQL Server 2005.  If you want to put any other edition into production you&apos;ll need to join their &lt;a href=&quot;https://profile.microsoft.com/Regsysprofilecenter/wizard.aspx?wizid=6dda9933-987a-445d-8304-19e06a5d0da7&amp;lcid=1033&quot;&gt;TAP program&lt;/a&gt;.  I can&apos;t imagine they&apos;re going to take a huge number of organizations into that program.

&lt;P&gt;(As I type this, the April CTP isn&apos;t available on MSDN yet but keep you&apos;re eyes open.)</description>
