  <LI>An agent is placed in an environment containing two slot machines, =
each of=20
  which costs $1 to play. The expected payoffs are <I>c</I> and <I>d</I> =
and the=20
  agent can play each machine as many times as it likes. Describe, in=20
  qualitative terms, how a rational agent should behave in each of the =
following=20
  cases:<BR>(a) The agent knows that <I>c</I> =3D 2 and <I>d</I> =3D =
0.75.<BR>(b)=20
  The agent knows that <I>c</I> =3D 2 but <I>d</I> is unknown.<BR>(c) =
The agent=20
  knows that <I>c</I> =3D 0.995 but <I>d</I> is unknown.<BR>(d) <I>c</I> =
and=20
  <I>d</I> are unknown.<BR>(Hint: Remember your PEAS! Not everything is =
fully=20
  specified in the question; you need to fill in the missing =
specifications.)=20
  <P></P>
  <LI>Let us examine the rationality of various vacuum-cleaner agent=20
  functions.<BR>(a) Show that the simple vacuum-cleaner agent function =
described=20
  in Figure 2.3 of AIMA2e is indeed rational under the assumptions =
listed on=20
  page 36.<BR>(b) Describe a rational agent function for the modified=20
  performance measure that deducts one point for each movement. Does the =

  corresponding agent program require internal state?<BR>(c) Discuss =
possible=20
  agent designs for the cases in which clean squares can become dirty =
and the=20
  geography of the environment is unknown. Does it make sense for the =
agent to=20
  learn from its experience in these cases? If so, what should it learn? =

  <P></P>
  <LI>For each of the following agents, develop a PEAS description of =
the task=20
  environment (including a characterization of the environment along the =
six=20
  dimensions given in lecture): <BR>(a) Robot table-tennis =
player.<BR>(b) Lisp=20
  interpreter (the program that starts when you run "alisp").<BR>(c) =
Autonomous=20
  Mars rover.=20
  <P></P>
  <LI>Give the initial state, goal test, successor function, and cost =
function=20
  for each of the following. Choose a formulation that is precise enough =
to be=20
  implemented. You are not required to supply the solutions! <BR>(a) You =
have to=20
  color a planar map using only three colors, with no two adjacent =
regions=20
  having the same color. <BR>(b) A 3-foot-tall monkey is in a room where =
some=20
  bananas are suspended from the 8-foot ceiling. He would like to get =
the=20
  bananas. The room contains two stackable, movable, climbable 3-foot =
high=20
  crates. <BR>(c) You have three jugs measuring 12 gallons, 8 gallons, =
and 3=20
  gallons, and a water faucet. You need to measure out exactly one =
gallon.=20
  <P></P>
  <LI>Consider a state space where the start state is number 1, and the=20
  successor function for state <I>n</I> returns two states labelled =
2<I>n</I>=20
  and 2<I>n</I>+1. <BR>(a) Draw the portion of the state space for =
states 1 to=20
  15. <BR>(b) Suppose that the goal state is 11. List the order in which =
nodes=20
  will be visited for breadth-first search, depth-limited search with =
depth=20
  limit 3, and iterative deepening search. <BR>(c) Can you apply =
best-first=20
  search to this problem? What would be a good heuristic? List the order =
in=20
  which nodes are visited in searching for the goal of 11 using your =
heuristic.=20
  <BR>(d) Would bidirectional search be appropriate for this problem? If =
so,=20
  describe how it would work. What is the branching factor in each =
direction of=20
  the bidirectional search? Does this suggest a reformulation of the =
problem=20
  that would allow you to solve the problem of getting from state 1 to a =
given=20
  goal state with almost no search at all?=20
  <P></P>
  <LI>Consider the problem of <I>constructing</I> (not solving) =
crossword=20
  puzzles: fitting words into the white squares of a predetermined grid =
whose=20
  black and white squares are already fixed. Assume that a list of words =
(i.e.,=20
  a dictionary) is provided, and that the task is to fill in the white =
squares=20
  using any subset of this list. Go through a complete goal and problem=20
  formulation for this domain, and choose a search strategy to solve it. =
Specify=20
  the heuristic function, if you think one is needed.=20
  <P></P>
  <LI>Prove that if a heuristic is consistent, it must be admissible. =
Construct=20
  an admissible heuristic that is not consistent.=20
  <P></P>
  <LI>A knight moves on a chessboard two squares up, down, left, or =
right=20
  followed by one square in one of the two directions perpendicular to =
the first=20
  part of the move. (I.e., the move is L-shaped.) Suppose the knight is =
on an=20
  unbounded board at square (0,0) and we wish to move it to square (x,y) =
in the=20
  smallest number of moves. (For example, to move from (0,0) to (1,1) =
requires=20
  two moves.)<BR>(a) Explain how to decide whether the required number =
of moves=20
  is even or odd without constructing a solution.<BR>(b) Design an=20
  <I>admissible</I> heuristic function for estimating the minimum number =
of=20
  moves required; it should be as accurate as you can make it. Prove =
rigorously=20
  that your heuristic is admissible.<BR>(c) (Extra credit) Implement the =
problem=20
  and your heuristic using the AIMA code; measure and plot the required=20
  computation time as a function of solution length for randomly =
generated=20
  problem instances of increasing distance.=20
  <P></P>
  <LI>On page 108 of AIMA2e, the authors define a relaxation of the =
8-puzzle in=20
  which a tile can move in one step from square A to square B if B is =
blank. The=20
  exact solution of this problem defines <I>Gaschnig's heuristic</I> =
(Gaschnig,=20
  1979). Explain why Gaschnig's heuristic is at least as accurate as=20
  <I>h</I><SUB>1</SUB> (misplaced tiles), and show cases where it is =
more=20
  accurate than both <I>h</I><SUB>1</SUB> and <I>h</I><SUB>2</SUB> =
(Manhattan=20
  distance). Can you suggest a way to calculate Gaschnig's heuristic=20
  efficiently?=20
  <P></P>
  <LI>In this exercise, we will examine hill-climbing in the context of =
planar=20
  robot navigation among polygonal obstacles (as in Figure 3.22 of =
AIMA2e).=20
  <BR>(a) Explain how hill-climbing would work as a method of reaching a =

  particular point goal. <BR>(b) Show how nonconvex obstacles can result =
in a=20
  local maximum for the hill-climber, using an example. <BR>(c) Is it=20
  <I>possible</I> for it to get stuck with convex obstacles? <BR>(d) =
Would=20
  simulated annealing always escape local maxima on this family of =
problems?=20
