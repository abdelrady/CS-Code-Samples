<H3>1. <A name=3DSocketQuestions>Socket questions</A></H3>
<H4><A name=3D1.1>1.1</A> Should I use ServerSocket or DatagramSocket in =
my=20
applications?</H4>
<P>DatagramSocket allows a server to accept UDP packets, whereas =
ServerSocket=20
allows an application to accept TCP connections. It depends on the =
protocol=20
you're trying to implement. If you're creating a new protocol, here's a =
few tips=20

<UL>
  <LI>DatagramSockets communciate using UDP packets. These packets don't =

  guarantee delivery - you'll need to handle missing packets in your=20
  client/server<BR>
  <LI>ServerSockets communicate using TCP connections. TCP guarantees =
delivery,=20
  so all you need to do is have your applications read and write using a =

  socket's InputStream and OutputStream. </LI></UL>
<H4><A name=3D1.2>1.2</A> How do I get the IP address of a machine from =
its=20
hostname?</H4>
<P>The InetAddress class is able to resolve IP addresses for you. Obtain =
an=20
instance of InetAddress for the machine, and call the getHostAddress() =
method,=20
which returns a string in the xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx address =
form.</P><PRE>InetAddress inet =3D =
InetAddress.getByName("www.davidreilly.com");
System.out.println ("IP  : " + inet.getHostAddress());</PRE>
<H4><A name=3D1.3>1.3</A> How do I perform a hostname lookup for an IP=20
address?</H4>
<P>The InetAddress class contains a method that can return the domain =
name of an=20
IP address. You need to obtain an InetAddress class, and then call its=20
getHostName() method. This will return the hostname for that IP address. =

Depending on the platform, a partial or a fully qualified hostname may =
be=20
returned.</P><PRE>InetAddress inet =3D =
InetAddress.getByName("209.204.220.121");
System.out.println ("Host: " + inet.getHostName());</PRE>
<H4><A name=3D1.4>1.4</A> How can I find out who is accessing my =
server?</H4>
<P>If you're using a DatagramSocket, every packet that you receive will =
contain=20
the address and port from which it was sent.</P><PRE>DatagramPacket =
packet =3D null;

// Receive next packet
myDatagramSocket.receive ( packet );

// Print address + port
System.out.println ("Packet from : " +=20
	packet.getAddress().getHostAddress() + ':' + packet.getPort());</PRE>
<P>If you're using a ServerSocket, then every socket connection you =
accept will=20
contain similar information. The Socket class has a getInetAddress() and =

getPort() method which will allow you to find the same =
information.</P><PRE>Socket mySock =3D myServerSocket.accept();

// Print address + port
System.out.println ("Connection from : " +=20
	mySock.getInetAddress().getHostAddress() + ':' + mySock.getPort());	=
</PRE>
<H4><A name=3D1.5>1.5</A> How can I find out the current IP address for =
my=20
machine?</H4>
<P>The InetAddress has a static method called getLocalHost() which will =
return=20
the current address of the local machine. You can then use the =
getHostAddress()=20
method to get the IP address.</P><PRE>InetAddress local =3D =
InetAddress.getLocalHost();

// Print address
System.out.println ("Local IP : " + local.getHostAddress());</PRE>
<H4><A name=3D1.6>1.6</A> Why can't my applet connect via sockets, or =
bind to a=20
local port?</H4>
<P>Applets are subject to heavy security constraints when executing =
under the=20
control of a browser. Applets are unable to access the local =
file-system, to=20
bind to local ports, or to connect to a computer via sockets other than =
the=20
computer from which the applet is loaded. While it may seem to be an =
annoyance=20
for developers, there are many good reasons why such tight constraints =
are=20
placed on applets. Applets could bind to well known ports, and service =
network=20
clients without authorization or consent. Applets executing within =
firewalls=20
could obtain privileged information, and then send it across the =
network.=20
Applets could even be infected by viruses, such as the Java StrangeBrew =
strain.=20
Applets might become infected without an applet author's knowledge and =
then send=20
information back that might leave hosts vulnerable to attack.</P>
<P>Signed applets may be allowed greater freedom by browsers than =
unsigned=20
applets, which could be an option. In cases where an applet must be =
capable of=20
network communication, HTTP can be used as a communication mechanism. An =
applet=20
could communicate via java.net.URLConnection with a CGI script, or a =
Java=20
servlet. This has an added advantage - applets that use the =
URLConnection will=20
be able to communicate through a firewall.</P>
<H4><A name=3D1.7>1.7</A> What are socket options, and why should I use =
them?</H4>
<P>Socket options give developers greater control over how sockets =
behave. Most=20
socket behavior is controlled by the operating system, not Java itself, =
but as=20
of JDK1.1, you can control several socket options, including SO_TIMEOUT, =

SO_LINGER, TCP_NODELAY, SO_RCVBUF and SO_SNDBUF.</P>
<P>These are advanced options, and many programmers may want to ignore =
them.=20
That's OK, but be aware of their existence for the future. You might =
like to=20
specify a timeout for read operations, to control the amount of time a=20
connection will linger for before a reset is sent, whether Nagle's =
algorithm is=20
enabled/disabled, or the send and receive buffers for datagram =
sockets.</P>
<H4><A name=3D1.8>1.8</A> When my client connects to my server, why does =
no data=20
come out?</H4>
<P>This is a common problem, made more difficult by the fact that the =
fault may=20
lie in either the client, or the server, or both. The first step is to =
try and=20
isolate the cause of the problem, by checking whether the server is =
responding=20
correctly.</P>
<P>If you're writing a TCP service, then you can telnet to the port the =
server=20
uses, and check to see if it is responding to data. If so, then the =
fault is=20
more than likely in the client, and if not, you've found your problem. A =

debugger can be very helpful in tracking down the precise location of =
server=20
errors. You could try jdb, which comes with JDK, or use an IDE's =
debugger like=20
Visual J++ or Borland JBuilder.</P>
<P>If your fault looks like it is in the client, then it can often be =
caused by=20
buffered I/O. If you're using a buffered stream, or a writer (such as=20
PrintWriter), you may need to manually flush the data. Otherwise, it =
will be=20
queued up but not sent, causing both client and server to stall. The =
problem can=20
even be intermittent, as the buffer will flush sometimes (when it =
becomes full)=20
but not other times.</P>
<H4><A name=3D1.9>1.9</A> What is the cause of a =
NoRouteToHostException?</H4>
<P>Usually this means that there isn't an active Internet connection =
through=20
which a socket connection may take place, or that there is a nasty =
little=20
firewall in the way. Firewalls are the bane of users and developers =
alike -=20
while useful for security, they make legitimate networking software =
harder to=20
support.<A=20
href=3D"http://www.davidreilly.com/java/java_network_programming/jnpfaq.t=
xt">java/java_network_programming/jnpfaq.txt</A></P>
<P>Your best option is to try using a SOCKS proxy, or to use a different =

protocol, like HTTP. If you still have firewall problems, you can =
manually=20
specify a HTTP proxy server (see <A=20
href=3D"http://www.davidreilly.com/java/java_network_programming/#2.4">se=
ction=20
2.4</A>)</P>
<P>This is a common problem, made more difficult by the fact that the =
fault may=20
lie in either the client, or the server, or both. The first step is to =
try and=20
isolate the cause of the problem, by checking whether the server is =
responding=20
correctly.</P>
<H3>2. <A name=3DHTTPQuestions>HTTP Questions</A></H3>
<H4><A name=3D2.1>2.1</A> How do I display a particular web page from an =

applet?</H4>
<P>An applet can instruct a web browser to load a particular page, using =
the=20
showDocument method of the java.applet.AppletContext class. If you want =
to=20
display a web page, you first have to obtain a reference to the current =
applet=20
context.</P>
<P>The following code snippet shows you how this can be done. The show =
page=20
method is capable of displaying any URL passed to it.</P><PRE>import =
java.net.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.applet.*;

public class MyApplet extends Applet
{
	// Your applet code goes here

	// Show me a page
	public void showPage ( String mypage )
	{
		URL myurl =3D null;

		// Create a URL object
		try
		{
			myurl =3D new URL ( mypage );
		}
		catch (MalformedURLException e)
		{
			// Invalid URL
		}
		=09
		// Show URL
		if (myurl !=3D null)
		{
			getAppletContext().showDocument (myurl);
		}

	}
}</PRE>
<H4><A name=3D2.2>2.2</A> How do I display more than one page from an =
applet?</H4>
<P>The showDocument method of the AppletContext interface is overloaded =
-=20
meaning that it can accept more than one parameter. It can accept a =
second=20
parameter, which represents the name of the browser window that should =
display a=20
page.</P>
<P>For example,</P><PRE>myAppletContext.showDocument (myurl, =
"frame1")</PRE>
<P>will display the document in frame1. If there exists no window named =
frame1,=20
then a brand new window will be created.</P>
<H4><A name=3D2.3>2.3</A> How can I fetch files using HTTP?</H4>
<P>The easiest way to fetch files using HTTP is to use the java.net.URL =
class.=20
The openStream() method will return an InputStream instance, from which =
the file=20
contents can be read. For added control, you can use the =
openConnection()=20
method, which will return a URLConnection object.</P>
<P>Here's a brief example that demonstrates the use of the=20
java.net.URL.openStream() method to return the contents of a URL =
specified as a=20
command line parameter.</P><PRE>import java.net.*;

}</PRE>
<H4><A name=3D2.4>2.4</A> How do I use a proxy server for HTTP =
requests?</H4>
<P>When a Java applet under the control of a browser (such as Netscape =
or=20
Internet Explorer) fetches content via a URLConnection, it will =
automatically=20
and transparently use the proxy settings of the browser.</P>
<P>If you're writing an application, however, you'll have to manually =
specify=20
the proxy server settings. You can do this when running a Java =
application, or=20
you can write code that will specify proxy settings automatically for =
the user=20
(providing you allow the users to customize the settings to suit their =
proxy=20
servers).</P>
<P>To specify proxy settings when running an application, use the -D =
parameter=20
:</P><PRE>jre -DproxySet=3Dtrue -DproxyHost=3Dmyhost =
-DproxyPort=3Dmyport MyApp</PRE>
<P>Alternately, your application can maintain a configuration file, and =
specify=20
proxy settings before using a URLConnection :</P><PRE>// Modify system =
properties
Properties sysProperties =3D System.getProperties();

// Specify proxy settings
sysProperties.put("proxyHost", "myhost");
sysProperties.put("proxyPort", "myport");
sysProperties.put("proxySet",  "true");</PRE>
<H4><A name=3D2.5>2.5</A> What is a malformed url, and why is it =
exceptional?</H4>
<P>When you create an instance of the java.net.URL class, its =
constructor can=20
throw a MalformedURLException. This occurs when the URL is invalid. When =
it is=20
thrown, it isn't because the host machine is down, or the URL path =
points to a=20
missing file; a malformed URL exception is thrown when the URL cannot be =

correctly parsed.</P>
<P>Common mistakes include :-=20
<UL>
  <LI>leaving out a protocol (eg "www.microsoft.com" instead of=20
  "http://www.microsoft.com/")=20
  <LI>specifying an invalid protocol (eg "www://netscape.com")=20
  <LI>leaving out the ':' character (eg http//www.micrsoft.com/) =
</LI></UL>
<P>MalformedURLException will not be thrown if :-=20
<UL>
  <LI>the host name is invalid (eg "www.microsoft-rules-the-world.com")=20
  <LI>the path is invalid (eg =
"http://www.microsoft.com/company_secrets.htm")=20
  </LI></UL>
<H4><A name=3D2.6>2.6</A> How do I URL encode the parameters of a CGI =
script?</H4>
<P>This is an important question, as many Java applications and applets =
interact=20
with server side applications, servlets, and CGI scripts. Let's take a =
look at=20
how URL encoding works first though.</P>
<P>A URL can be used to invoke a server side application or script's GET =
method.=20
The first part of the URL will be the name of the server side script, =
followed=20
by a question mark '?' character. After that will come the name of each=20
parameter, and '=3D' sign to separate name from value, and a '&amp;' =
character to=20
indicate the next parameter. Here's a fictitious example.</P>
<P><A=20
href=3D"http://www.yourwebhost.com/yourcgi.cgi?name=3Dyour%20name&amp;ema=
il=3Demail@email.com">http://www.yourwebhost.com/yourcgi.cgi?name=3Dyour%=
20name&amp;email=3Demail@email.com</A></P>
<P>We can't include spaces or other high/low ASCII values, so the space=20
character has been substituted for %20 in this example. Java provides a=20
URLEncoder class to do this for us - we need only construct the URL and =
pass it=20
to the URLEncoder. Here's a quick code example to =
demonstrate.</P><PRE>String encodedURL =3D =
"http://www.yourwebhost.com/yourcgi?name=3D" +
   // encode as value may have spaces or other characters
   URLEncoder.encode("david reilly" );
System.out.println ("Encoded URL - " + encodedURL);</PRE>
<H4><A name=3D2.7>2.7</A> Why is a security exception thrown when using=20
java.net.URL or<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; java.net.URLConnection =
from an=20
applet?</H4>
<P>Web browsers impose security restrictions on applets, which prevent =
applets=20
from establishing network connections to servers other than that from =
which they=20
were loaded. Like socket connections, HTTP connections will cause =
security=20
exceptions to be thrown. If you absolutely, positively, have to access =
other=20
hosts (and replacing your applet with a Java servlet is impractical), =
consider=20
using a digitally signed applet.</P>
<H4><A name=3D2.8>2.8</A> How do I prevent caching of HTTP =
requests?</H4>
<P>By default, caching will be enabled. You must use a URLConnection, =
rather=20
than the URL.openStream() method, and explicitly specify that you do not =
want to=20
cache the requests. This is achieved by calling the=20
URLConnection.setUseCaches(boolean) method with a value of =
false.&nbsp;</P>

<H3><A name=3D3.>3.</A> Advanced networking concepts</H3>
<H4><A name=3D3.1>3.1</A> How do I handle timeouts in my networking=20
applications?</H4>
<P>If your application is written for JDK1.1 or higher, you can use =
socket=20
options to generate a timeout after a read operation blocks for a =
specified=20
length of time. This is by far the easiest method of handling timeouts. =
A call=20
to the java.net.Socket.setSoTimeout() method allows you to specify the =
maximum=20
amount of time a Socket I/O operation will block before throwing an=20
InterruptedIOException. This allows you to trap read timeouts, and =
handle them=20
correctly. For an article on the subject, see <A=20
href=3D"http://www.javacoffeebreak.com/articles/network_timeouts/">http:/=
/www.javacoffeebreak.com/articles/network_timeouts/</A>.</P>
<P>If you're trying to handle connection timeouts, or if your =
application must=20
support earlier versions of Java, then another option is the use of =
threads.=20
Multi-threaded applications can wait for timeouts, and then perform some =
action=20
(such as resetting a connection or notifying the user). However, you as =
a=20
programmer should avoid writing complex multi-threaded code - =
particularly in=20
your clients. There's usually an easy way to encapsulate the complexity =
of=20
multi-threading, and provide a simple non-blocking I/O version. An =
article that=20
demonstrates this technique for connect operations is available at <A=20
href=3D"http://www.javaworld.com/jw-09-1999/jw-09-timeout.html">http://ww=
w.javaworld.com/jw-09-1999/jw-09-timeout.html</A></P>
<H4><A name=3D3.2>3.2</A> How do I control the amount of time a socket =
will linger=20
before resetting?</H4>
<P>When a socket wishes to terminate a connection it can "linger", =
allowing=20
unsent data to be transmitted, or it can "reset" which means that all =
unsent=20
data will be lost. You can explicitly set a delay before a reset is =
sent, giving=20
more time for data to be read, or you can specify a delay of zero, =
meaning a=20
reset will be sent as the java.net.Socket.close() method is invoked.</P>
<P>The socket option SO_LINGER controls whether a connection will be =
aborted,=20
and if so, the linger delay. Use the java.net.Socket.setSoLinger method, =
which=20
accepts as parameters a boolean and an int. The boolean flag will=20
activate/deactivate the SO_LINGER option, and the int will control the =
delay=20
time.</P>
<H4><A name=3D3.3>3.3</A> What does the java.net.Socket.<B>setTcpNoDelay =
method=20
do, and what</B> is Nagle's algorithm?</H4>
<P>This method controls the socket option TCP_NODELAY, which allows =
applications=20
to enable or disable Nagle's algorithm. Nagle's algorithm (described in =
RFC=20
896), conserves bandwidth by minimizing the number of segments that are =
sent.=20
When applications wish to decrease network latency and increase =
performance,=20
they can disable Nagle's algorithm. Data will be sent earlier, at the =
cost of an=20
increase in bandwidth consumption.</P>
<H4><A name=3D3.4>3.4</A> How do I implement a=20
(FTP/HTTP/Telnet/Finger/SMTP/POP/IMAP/..../) client/server?</H4>
<P>Your first step towards creating such systems will be to read the =
relevant=20
Request For Comments (RFCs) document. Not sure which one? There are =
specific=20
search engines, such as <A=20
href=3D"http://www.rfc-editor.org/">http://www.rfc-editor.org/</A>, that =
will=20
allow you to search for the name of a protocol, and to then read =
relevant=20
documents. These RFCs describe the protocol you wish to implement.</P>
<H4><A name=3D3.5>3.5</A> How do I implement PING in Java?</H4>
<P>Java includes support for UDP and TCP sockets. PING requires support =
for the=20
Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP). Your only choice (at the =
moment), is=20
to use native code, or to use java.lang.Runtime to execute an external =
ping=20
application. You won't be able to develop a 100% Pure =
implementation.</P>
<P>NB - A native implementation that uses the Java Native Interface =
(JNI) is=20
available for PING, in both English and Spanish. See <A=20

for more details.</P>
<H4><A name=3D3.6>3.6</A> How can I send/receive email from Java?</H4>
<P>You can choose to implement Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), to =
send=20
email, and either POP or IMAP to receive email. However, an easier =
alternative=20
is to use the JavaMail API, which provides a set of classes for mail and =

messaging applications. Royalty-free implementations of the API are now=20
available from Sun for SMTP, POP and IMAP - and many other mail systems =
are=20
supported by third-parties. For more information, visit the official =

<H3><A name=3D4.>4.</A> Remote method invocation</H3>
<H4><A name=3D4.1>4.1</A> What is remote method invocation?</H4>
<P>Remote method invocation (RMI), is a mechanism for invoking an =
object's=20
methods, even though the object is executing on a foreign Java Virtual =
Machine=20
(JVM). RMI is similar to remote procedure calls (RPCs), but has an added =

advantage - method signatures can contain Java objects as well as =
primitive data=20
types. Even objects that a foreign JVM has never encountered before can =
be used,=20
so new tasks and methods can be passed across a network.</P>
<H4><A name=3D4.2>4.2</A> When should I use remote method =
invocation?</H4>
<P>Here's a few rules of thumb :=20
<UL>
  <LI>When you wish to execute code on remote systems (distributed =

<H3><A name=3D5.>5.</A> Common Object Request Broker Architecture</H3>
<H4><A name=3D5.1>5.1</A> What is CORBA?</H4>
<P>CORBA stands for Common Object Request Broker Architecture. CORBA is =
a=20
mechanism that allows applications to invoke object methods that will =
execute on=20
remote systems. CORBA isn't limited to any single platform, or language. =
CORBA=20
systems are written in C++, Ada, Java, and other languages. This makes =
it more=20
interoperable than remote procedure calls and remote method =
invocation.</P>
<H4><A name=3D5.2>5.2</A> When should I use CORBA?</H4>
<P>Here's a few rules of thumb :=20
<UL>
  <LI>When you wish to use services that are running on remote machines=20
  (distributed systems)=20
  <LI>When you have a heterogeneous networking environment, containing =
systems=20
  that aren't capable of supporting JVMs because a port is not yet =
available=20
  <LI>When you want your applications to be accessed by other systems =
written in=20
  C, C++, Ada, Cobol, and other languages (including Java) </LI></UL>
<H4><A name=3D5.3>5.3</A> What support does Java have for CORBA?</H4>
<P>Third party class libraries allow you to write CORBA application =
clients and=20
services in earlier versions of Java, but support for CORBA is also =
included=20
with the newly released Java 2 Platform. Clients and services can be =
written=20
(though an extra download of the idltojava tool is required).&nbsp; For =
more=20
information on Java IDL, see <A=20

<H4><A name=3D5.4>5.4</A> How do I start the CORBA nameservice for Java =

<P>The nameservice can be started by running the tnameserv command, =
which should=20
be located in your Java 2 binaries directory. Remember however that this =
service=20

window.</P>
<H3><A name=3D6.>6.</A> Java Servlets</H3>
<H4><A name=3D6.1>6.1</A> What are servlets?</H4>
<P>Servlets are server-side Java applications, as opposed to client-side =
applets=20
or standalone applications. While servlets are compatible with many =
different=20
types of servers, typically they are used in web servers, as a =
replacement for=20
CGI scripts or Active-Server Pages (ASP).</P>
<P>Java servlets offer many advantages over other forms of server-side=20
processing. Apart from the obvious (they are written in the Java =
programming=20
language, a big plus after all), servlet based applications are far =
easier to=20
write than CGI scripts. There's no need to write code for parsing HTTP =
request=20
parameters, as this code is provided by the javax.servlet.http package. =
You have=20
access to the entire Java API, with no networking restrictions (making =
servlets=20
far more attractive than applets). There are also performance increases =
over CGI=20
scripts, as servlets persist over time, and do not create a new process =
for=20
every connection.</P>
<H4><A name=3D6.2>6.2</A> What do I need to develop servlets?</H4>
<P>To develop servlets, you need a basic familiarity with Java I/O =
streams,=20
HTML, and the HyperText-Transfer Protocol (HTTP). You'll also need to =
download=20
the Java Servlet Development Kit (JSDK) which is freely available from =
Sun=20
Microsystems. Finally, you'll need a web-server that supports servlets, =
or a=20
servlet engine which augments your server's capability.</P>
<H4><A name=3D6.3>6.3</A> Where can I get more information on =
servlets?</H4>
<P>Gamelan's TechFocus recently published a two-part introductory =
tutorial on=20
servlets, which I can highly recommend. For more information see <A=20
href=3D"http://www.gamelan.com/journal/techworkshop/">http://www.gamelan.=
com/journal/techworkshop/</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>I also highly recommend the book, Developing Java Servlets, by James=20
Goodwill. The publisher is Sams, and the ISBN is 0672316005.</P>
<P>For more information, see&nbsp;<BR><A=20
href=3D"http://www.davidreilly.com/goto.cgi?isbn=3D0672316005">http://www=
.davidreilly.com/goto.cgi?isbn=3D0672316005</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<H4><A name=3D6.4>6.4</A> How does servlet performance compare to =
applets?</H4>
<P>Client-side Java has been dogged by performance problems due to slow =
loading=20
times, older JVMs without JIT compilation, and inefficient coding. =
Applets have=20
gained a reputation of poor performance, which often gives Java itself a =
bad=20
name. Server-side Java, however, doesn't suffer from the same =
performance=20
problems. The speed of execution is much better, as the server =
administrator can=20
install more recent JVMs (some of which are optimized for server-side=20
processing). The load time is virtually instantaneous, as there is no =
network=20
latency to contend with. You're also in a better position regarding =
security=20
restrictions - servlets can establish network connections without the =
sandbox=20
problems that plague unsigned applets.&nbsp;</P>
<H4><A name=3D6.5>6.5</A> How does servlet performance compare to =
CGI?</H4>
<P>Servlet performance is often far superior to CGI. Rather than forking =
a new=20
process for each request, a pool of threads can be used to execute =
servlet=20
requests. Servlets persist across connections, so there's no need to =
perform=20
initialization tasks repeatedly. This, when coupled with a fast JVM and =
servlet=20
engine, can offer better performance than CGI.</P>
<H4><A name=3D6.6>6.6</A> Should I use single-threaded, or =
multi-threaded=20
servlets?</H4>
<P>By default, servlets are multi-threaded. If you specifically require =
a=20
single-threaded servlet, you should implement the=20
<CODE>javax.servlet.SingleThreadModel</CODE> interface. This guarantees =
that no=20
two threads will be operating on the same instance of the servlet, but =
still=20
allows concurrent execution of the servlet. The servlet engine will =
maintain a=20
pool of available threads, and create new instances of the servlet as =
required.=20
This can cause performance problems however, and should be used =
sparingly except=20
on low-traffic servers.</P>
<H4><A name=3D6.7>6.7</A> How do I send cookies from a servlet?</H4>
<P>HTTP is a stateless protocol, which makes tracking user actions =
difficult.=20
One solution is to use a cookie, which is a small piece of data sent by =
a web=20
browser every time it requests a page from a particular site. Servlets, =
and CGI=20
scripts, can send cookies when a HTTP request is made - though as =
always, there=20
is no guarantee the browser will accept it.</P>
<P>Cookies are represented by the <CODE>javax.servlet.http.Cookie</CODE> =
class.=20
<CODE>Cookie</CODE> has a single constructor, which takes two strings (a =
key and=20
a value).&nbsp;</P><PRE>// Create a new cookie
Cookie cookie =3D new Cookie ("counter", "1");</PRE>
<P>Adding a cookie to a browser is easy. Cookies are sent as part of a=20
HTTPServletResponse, using the addCookie( Cookie ) method. You can call =
this=20
method multiple times, but remember that most browsers impose a limit of =
ten=20
cookies, and 4096 bytes of data per hostname.</P><PRE>public void doGet =
(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
 throws IOException
{
	response.addCookie(new Cookie("cookie_name", "cookie_value"));
}</PRE>
<H4><A name=3D6.8>6.8</A> How do I read browser cookies from a =
servlet?</H4>
<P>Reading cookies from a servlet is quite easy. You can gain access to =
any=20
cookies sent by the browser from the=20
<CODE>javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest</CODE> passed to the =
servlet's=20
doGet, doPost, etc methods. <CODE>HttpServletResponse</CODE> offers a =
method,=20
<CODE>Cookies[] getCookies()</CODE> which returns an array of=20
<CODE>Cookie</CODE> objects. However, if no cookies are available, this =
value=20
may be null, so be sure to check before accessing any array =
elements.</P><PRE>// Check for cookies
Cookie[] cookie_jar =3D request.getCookies();

// Check to see if any cookies exists
if (cookie_jar !=3D null)
{
	for (int i =3D0; i&lt; cookies.length; i++)
	{
		Cookie aCookie =3D cookie_jar[i];
		pout.println ("Name : " + aCookie.getName());
		pout.println ("Value: " + aCookie.getValue());
	}
}</PRE>
<H4><A name=3D6.9>6.9</A> How do I make cookies expire after a set time=20
period?</H4>
<P>Depending on how you use the data stored in a cookie, it is sometimes =
a good=20
idea to make the cookie expire. Since anyone using the browser will have =
the=20
cookie sent on their behalf, it may appear to be a legitimate user when =
in=20
actual fact it is not. This often happens in places like Internet cafes, =
school=20
or university computing labs, or libraries. If your cookie sends a user=20
identifier that facilitates access to sensitive data, or allows changes =
to be=20
made (for example, a web-based email service), then you should expire =
cookies=20
after a small time period. If the user keeps using your servlet, you =
always have=20
the option of resending the cookie with a longer duration.</P>
<P>To specify an expiration time, you can use the =
<CODE>setMaxTime(int)</CODE>=20
method of <CODE>javax.servlet.http.Cookie</CODE>. It takes as a =
parameter the=20
number of seconds before the cookie will expire. For example, for a five =
minute=20
expiration, we would do the following :-</P><PRE>// Create a new cookie =
for userID from a fictitious
// method called getUserID
Cookie cookie =3D new Cookie ("userID", getUserID());

// Expire the cookie in five minutes (5 * 60)
cookie.setMaxTime( 300 );</PRE>
<P>When the cookie is sent back to the browser, using=20
<CODE>HttpServletResponse.addCookie(Cookie)</CODE>, it will only be =
returned by=20
the browser until the expiration date occurs. If you'd prefer, you can =
also=20
specify a negative value for <CODE>setMaxTime(int)</CODE>, and the =
cookie will=20
expire as soon as the browser exits. Note however that not everyone will =

shutdown their browser, and it might be available for minutes, hours =
even days.=20
Finally, specifying a value of zero will expire the cookie =
instantly.</P>
<H4><A name=3D6.10>6.10</A> Why aren't cookies stored by my servlets =
accessible to=20
my CGI scripts or ASP pages?</H4>
<P>By default, cookies are accessible to every HTTP request for the =
current=20
directory, and any subdirectories. Now on most web servers and servlet =
engines,=20
servlets are located in a special directory. For example, when using=20
<CODE>servletrunner</CODE> (which ships with the Java Servlet =
Development Kit),=20
servlets must be invoked under the <I>/servlet/</I> =
directory.&nbsp;</P><PRE>http://webserver/servlet/servletname</PRE>
<P>If you want your cookies to be accessible elsewhere, you must specify =
the=20
root path of your webserver, using the =
<CODE>javax.servlet.Cookie.setPath(=20
String )</CODE> method.</P><PRE>// Create a cookie for everyone to share
Cookie myCookie =3D new Cookie ("counter", "1");

// Set path for cookie
myCookie.setPath( "/" );</PRE>
<P>Once you've set the path, any script (for example, stored in=20
<I>/cgi-bin/</I>) can access the cookies stored by your servlets.</P>
<H4><A name=3D6.11>6.11</A> How can I void a cookie, and delete it from =
the=20
browser?</H4>
<P>You can specify an expiration date, using the =
<CODE>setMaxTime(int)</CODE>=20
method of <CODE>javax.servlet.http.Cookie</CODE>. Specifying a =
expiration time=20
of zero will void the cookie, and delete it from the browser.</P><PRE>// =
Expire the cookie immediately
cookie.setMaxTime( 0 );

// Send cookie back to the browser to void it
response.addCookie(cookie);</PRE>
