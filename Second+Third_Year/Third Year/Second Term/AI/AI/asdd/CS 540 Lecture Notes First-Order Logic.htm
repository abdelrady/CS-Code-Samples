<H3>First-Order Logic (FOL or FOPC) Syntax</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>User defines these primitives: 
  <UL>
    <LI><B>Constant symbols</B> (i.e., the "individuals" in the world) E.g., 
    Mary, 3 
    <LI><B>Function symbols</B> (mapping individuals to individuals) E.g., 
    father-of(Mary) = John, color-of(Sky) = Blue 
    <LI><B>Predicate symbols</B> (mapping from individuals to truth values) 
    E.g., greater(5,3), green(Grass), color(Grass, Green) </LI></UL>
  <P></P>
  <LI>FOL supplies these primitives: 
  <UL>
    <LI><B>Variable symbols</B>. E.g., <TT>x</TT>, <TT>y</TT> 
    <LI><B>Connectives</B>. Same as in PL: not (~), and (^), or (v), implies 
    (=&gt;), if and only if (&lt;=&gt;) 
    <LI><B>Quantifiers</B>: Universal (<TT>A</TT>) and Existential (<TT>E</TT>) 
    <UL>
      <LI>Universal quantification corresponds to conjunction ("and") in that 
      <TT>(Ax)P(x)</TT> means that <TT>P</TT> holds for all values of <TT>x</TT> 
      in the domain associated with that variable. E.g., <TT>(Ax) dolphin(x) 
      =&gt; mammal(x)</TT> 
      <LI>Existential quantification corresponds to disjunction ("or") in that 
      <TT>(Ex)P(x)</TT> means that <TT>P</TT> holds for some value of <TT>x</TT> 
      in the domain associated with that variable. E.g., <TT>(Ex) mammal(x) ^ 
      lays-eggs(x)</TT> 
      <LI>Universal quantifiers usually used with "implies" to form "if-then 
      rules." E.g., <TT>(Ax) cs540-student(x) =&gt; smart(x)</TT> means "All 
      cs540 students are smart." You rarely use universal quantification to make 
      blanket statements about every individual in the world: 
      <TT>(Ax)cs540-student(x) ^ smart(x)</TT> meaning that everyone in the 
      world is a cs540 student and is smart. 
      <LI>Existential quantifiers usually used with "and" to specify a list of 
      properties or facts about an individual. E.g., <TT>(Ex) cs540-student(x) ^ 
      smart(x)</TT> means "there is a cs540 student who is smart." A common 
      mistake is to represent this English sentence as the FOL sentence: 
      <TT>(Ex) cs540-student(x) =&gt; smart(x)</TT> But consider what happens 
      when there is a person who is NOT a cs540-student. 
      <LI>Switching the order of universal quantifiers does not change the 
      meaning: <TT>(Ax)(Ay)P(x,y)</TT> is logically equivalent to 
      <TT>(Ay)(Ax)P(x,y)</TT>. Similarly, you can switch the order of 
      existential quantifiers. 
      <LI>Switching the order of universals and existentials <I>does</I> change 
      meaning: 
      <UL>
        <LI>Everyone likes someone: <TT>(Ax)(Ey)likes(x,y)</TT> 
        <LI>Someone is liked by everyone: <TT>(Ey)(Ax)likes(x,y)</TT> 
      </LI></UL></LI></UL></LI></UL>
  <P></P>
  <LI>Sentences are built up from terms and atoms: 
  <UL>
    <LI>A <B>term</B> (denoting a real-world individual) is a constant symbol, a 
    variable symbol, or an n-place function of n terms. For example, <I>x</I> 
    and <I>f(x1, ..., xn)</I> are terms, where each <I>xi</I> is a term. 
    <LI>An <B>atom</B> (which has value true or false) is either an 
    <TT>n</TT>-place predicate of <TT>n</TT> terms, or, if <TT>P</TT> and 
    <TT>Q</TT> are atoms, then <TT>~P, P V Q, P ^ Q, P =&gt; Q, P &lt;=&gt; 
    Q</TT> are atoms 
    <LI>A <B>sentence</B> is an atom, or, if <TT>P</TT> is a sentence and 
    <TT>x</TT> is a variable, then <TT>(Ax)P</TT> and <TT>(Ex)P</TT> are 
    sentences 
    <LI>A <B>well-formed formula (wff)</B> is a sentence containing no "free" 
    variables. I.e., all variables are "bound" by universal or existential 
    quantifiers. E.g., <TT>(Ax)P(x,y)</TT> has <TT>x</TT> bound as a universally 
    quantified variable, but <TT>y</TT> is free. </LI></UL></LI></UL>

<P>
<H3>Inference Rules for FOL</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>Inference rules for PL apply to FOL as well. For example, Modus Ponens, 
  And-Introduction, And-Elimination, etc. 
  <LI>New (sound) inference rules for use with quantifiers: 
  <UL>
    <LI><B>Universal Elimination</B><BR>If <TT>(Ax)P(x)</TT> is true, then 
    <TT>P(c)</TT> is true, where <TT>c</TT> is a constant in the domain of 
    <TT>x</TT>. For example, from <TT>(Ax)eats(Ziggy, x)</TT> we can infer 
    <TT>eats(Ziggy, IceCream)</TT>. The variable symbol can be replaced by any 
    ground term, i.e., any constant symbol or function symbol applied to ground 
    terms only. 
    <LI><B>Existential Introduction</B><BR>If <TT>P(c)</TT> is true, then 
    <TT>(Ex)P(x)</TT> is inferred. For example, from <TT>eats(Ziggy, 
    IceCream)</TT> we can infer <TT>(Ex)eats(Ziggy, x)</TT>. All instances of 
    the given constant symbol are replaced by the new variable symbol. Note that 
    the variable symbol cannot already exist anywhere in the expression. 
    <LI><B>Existential Elimination</B><BR>From <TT>(Ex)P(x)</TT> infer 
    <TT>P(c)</TT>. For example, from <TT>(Ex)eats(Ziggy, x)</TT> infer 
    <TT>eats(Ziggy, Cheese)</TT>. Note that the variable is replaced by a 
    <I>brand new</I> constant that does not occur in this or <I>any other</I> 
    sentence in the Knowledge Base. In other words, we don't want to 
    accidentally draw other inferences about it by introducing the constant. All 
    we know is there must be <I>some</I> constant that makes this true, so we 
    can introduce a brand new one to stand in for that (unknown) constant. 
  </LI></UL>
  <LI><B>Paramodulation</B><BR>
  <UL>
    <LI>Given two sentences <TT>(P1 v ... v PN)</TT> and <TT>(t=s v Q1 v ... v 
    QM)</TT> where each <TT>Pi</TT> and <TT>Qi</TT> is a literal (see definition 
    below) and <TT>Pj</TT> contains a term <TT>t</TT>, derive new sentence 
    <TT>(P1 v ... v Pj-1 v Pj[s] v Pj+1 v ... v PN v Q1 v ... v QM)</TT> where 
    <TT>Pj[s]</TT> means a single occurrence of the term <TT>t</TT> is replaced 
    by the term <TT>s</TT> in <TT>Pj</TT> 
    <LI>Example: From <TT>P(a)</TT> and <TT>a=b</TT> derive <TT>P(b)</TT> 
  </LI></UL>
  <LI><B>Generalized Modus Ponens (GMP)</B><BR>
  <UL>
    <LI>Combines And-Introduction, Universal-Elimination, and Modus Ponens 
    <LI>Example: from <TT>P(c), Q(c)</TT>, and <TT>(Ax)(P(x) ^ Q(x)) =&gt; 
    R(x)</TT>, derive <TT>R(c)</TT> 
    <LI>In general, given atomic sentences <TT>P1, P2, ..., PN</TT>, and 
    implication sentence <TT>(Q1 ^ Q2 ^ ... ^ QN) =&gt; R</TT>, where <TT>Q1, 
    ..., QN</TT> and <TT>R</TT> are atomic sentences, and <TT>subst(Theta, Pi) = 
    subst(Theta, Qi)</TT> for i=1,...,N, derive new sentence: <TT>subst(Theta, 
    R)</TT> 
    <LI><TT>subst(Theta, alpha)</TT> denotes the result of applying a set of 
    substitutions defined by <TT>Theta</TT> to the sentence <TT>alpha</TT> 
    <LI>A substitution list <TT>Theta = {v1/t1, v2/t2, ..., vn/tn}</TT> means to 
    replace all occurrences of variable symbol <TT>vi</TT> by term <TT>ti</TT>. 
    Substitutions are made in left-to-right order in the list. Example: 
    <TT>subst({x/IceCream, y/Ziggy}, eats(y,x)) = eats(Ziggy, IceCream)</TT> 
    </LI></UL></LI></UL>
<P>
<H3>Automated Inference for FOL</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>Automated inference using FOL is harder than using PL because variables 
  can take on potentially an infinite number of possible values from their 
  domain. Hence there are potentially an infinite number of ways to apply 
  Universal-Elimination rule of inference 
  <LI>Godel's Completeness Theorem says that FOL entailment is only 
  semidecidable. That is, if a sentence is true given a set of axioms, there is 
  a procedure that will determine this. However, if the sentence is false, then 
  there is no guarantee that a procedure will ever determine this. In other 
  words, the procedure may never halt in this case. 
  <LI>The Truth Table method of inference is not complete for FOL because the 
  truth table size may be infinite 
  <LI>Natural Deduction is complete for FOL but is not practical for automated 
  inference because the "branching factor" in a search is too large, caused by 
  the fact that we would have to potentially try every inference rule in every 
  possible way using the set of known sentences 
  <LI>Generalized Modus Ponens is not complete for FOL 
  <LI>Generalized Modus Ponens is complete for KBs containing only <B>Horn 
  clauses</B> 
  <UL>
    <LI>A Horn clause is a sentence of the form:<BR><TT>(Ax) (P1(x) ^ P2(x) ^ 
    ... ^ Pn(x)) =&gt; Q(x)</TT><BR>where there are 0 or more <TT>Pi</TT>'s, and 
    the <TT>Pi</TT>'s and <TT>Q</TT> are positive (i.e., un-negated) literals 
    <LI>Horn clauses represent a subset of the set of sentences representable in 
    FOL. For example, <TT>P(a) v Q(a)</TT> is a sentence in FOL but is not a 
    Horn clause. 
    <LI>Natural deduction using GMP is complete for KBs containing only Horn 
    clauses. Proofs start with the given axioms/premises in KB, deriving new 
    sentences using GMP until the goal/query sentence is derived. This defines a 
    <B>forward chaining</B> inference procedure because it moves "forward" from 
    the KB to the goal. 
    <UL>
      <LI>Example: KB = All cats like fish, cats eat everything they like, and 
      Ziggy is a cat. In FOL, KB =<BR>
      <OL>
        <LI><TT>(Ax) cat(x) =&gt; likes(x, Fish)</TT> 
        <LI><TT>(Ax)(Ay) (cat(x) ^ likes(x,y)) =&gt; eats(x,y)</TT> 
        <LI><TT>cat(Ziggy)</TT> </LI></OL>
      <P>Goal query: Does Ziggy eat fish?
      <P>
      <P>Proof:<BR>
      <OL>
        <LI>Use GMP with (1) and (3) to derive: 4. <TT>likes(Ziggy, Fish)</TT> 
        <LI>Use GMP with (3), (4) and (2) to derive <TT>eats(Ziggy, Fish)</TT> 
        <LI>So, Yes, Ziggy eats fish. </LI></OL></LI></UL>
    <LI><B>Backward-chaining</B> deduction using GMP is complete for KBs 
    containing only Horn clauses. Proofs start with the goal query, find 
    implications that would allow you to prove it, and then prove each of the 
    antecedents in the implication, continuing to work "backwards" until we get 
    to the axioms, which we know are true. 
    <UL>
      <LI>Example: Does Ziggy eat fish?
      <P>To prove <TT>eats(Ziggy, Fish)</TT>, first see if this is known from 
      one of the axioms directly. Here it is not known, so see if there is a 
      Horn clause that has the consequent (i.e., right-hand side) of the 
      implication matching the goal. Here,
      <P>Proof:<BR>
      <OL>
        <LI>Goal matches RHS of Horn clause (2), so try and prove new sub-goals 
        <TT>cat(Ziggy)</TT> and <TT>likes(Ziggy, Fish)</TT> that correspond to 
        the LHS of (2) 
        <LI><TT>cat(Ziggy)</TT> matches axiom (3), so we've "solved" that 
        sub-goal 
        <LI><TT>likes(Ziggy, Fish)</TT> matches the RHS of (1), so try and prove 
        <TT>cat(Ziggy)</TT> 
        <LI><TT>cat(Ziggy)</TT> matches (as it did earlier) axiom (3), so we've 
        solved this sub-goal 
        <LI>There are no unsolved sub-goals, so we're done. Yes, Ziggy eats 
        fish. </LI></OL></LI></UL></LI></UL></LI></UL>

<H3>Resolution Refutation Procedure (aka Resolution Procedure)</H3>

  <LI>Unification is a "pattern matching" procedure that takes two atomic

  not match and a substitution list, <TT>Theta</TT>, if they do match. That is, 
  <TT>unify(p,q) = Theta</TT> means <TT>subst(Theta, p) = subst(Theta, q)</TT>

<H3>Resolution Refutation Procedure (aka Resolution Procedure)</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>Proof by contradiction method 
  <LI>Given a consistent set of axioms <TT>KB</TT> and goal sentence <TT>Q</TT>, 
  we want to show that <TT>KB |= Q</TT>. This means that every interpretation 
  <TT>I</TT> that satisfies <TT>KB</TT>, satisfies <TT>Q</TT>. But we know that 
  any interpretation <TT>I</TT> satisfies either <TT>Q</TT> or <TT>~Q</TT>, but 
  not both. Therefore if in fact <TT>KB |= Q</TT>, an interpretation that 
  satisfies KB, satisfies <TT>Q</TT> and does not satisfy <TT>~Q</TT>. Hence KB 
  union {<TT>~Q</TT>} is unsatisfiable, i.e., that it's false under all 
  interpretations. 
  <LI>In other words, <TT>(KB |- Q) &lt;=&gt; (KB ^ ~Q |- False)</TT> 
  <LI>What's the gain? If KB union <TT>~Q</TT> is unsatisfiable, then some 
  <I>finite</I> subset is unsatisfiable 
  <LI>Resolution procedure can be used to establish that a given sentence 
  <TT>Q</TT> is entailed by KB; however, it <I>cannot</I>, in general, be used 
  to generate all logical consequences of a set sentences. Also, the resolution 
  procedure cannot be used to prove that <TT>Q</TT> is <I>not</I> entailed by 
  KB. 
  <LI>Resolution procedure won't always give an answer since entailment is only 
  semidecidable. And you can't just run two proofs in parallel, one trying to 
  prove <TT>Q</TT> and the other trying to prove <TT>~Q</TT>, since KB might not 
  entail either one.

  <LI>Resolution rule of inference is only applicable with sentences that are in 
  the form <TT>P1 v P2 v ... v Pn</TT>, where each <TT>Pi</TT> is a negated or 
  un-negated predicate and contains functions, constants, and universally 
  quantified variables, so can we convert every FOL sentence into this form?

  <LI>How to pick which pair of literals, one from each sentence, to unify?

<H3>Converting FOL Sentences to Clause Form</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>Every FOL sentence can be converted to a logically equivalent sentence 
  that is in a "normal form" called <B>clause form</B> 
  <LI>Steps to convert a sentence to clause form: 
  <OL>
    <LI>Eliminate all <TT>&lt;=&gt;</TT> connectives by replacing each instance 
    of the form <TT>(P &lt;=&gt; Q)</TT> by the equivalent expression <TT>((P 
    =&gt; Q) ^ (Q =&gt; P))</TT> 
    <LI>Eliminate all <TT>=&gt;</TT> connectives by replacing each instance of 
    the form <TT>(P =&gt; Q)</TT> by <TT>(~P v Q)</TT> 
    <LI>Reduce the scope of each negation symbol to a single predicate by 
    applying equivalences such as converting <TT>~~P</TT> to <TT>P</TT>; <TT>~(P 
    v Q)</TT> to <TT>~P ^ ~Q</TT>; <TT>~(P ^ Q)</TT> to <TT>~P v ~Q</TT>; 
    <TT>~(Ax)P</TT> to <TT>(Ex)~P</TT>, and <TT>~(Ex)P</TT> to <TT>(Ax)~P</TT> 
    <LI>Standardize variables: rename all variables so that each quantifier has 
    its own unique variable name. For example, convert <TT>(Ax)P(x)</TT> to 
    <TT>(Ay)P(y)</TT> if there is another place where variable <TT>x</TT> is 
    already used. 
    <LI>Eliminate existential quantification by introducing <B>Skolem 
    functions</B>. For example, convert <TT>(Ex)P(x)</TT> to <TT>P(c)</TT> where 
    <TT>c</TT> is a brand new constant symbol that is not used in any other 
    sentence. <TT>c</TT> is called a <B>Skolem constant</B>. More generally, if 
    the existential quantifier is within the scope of a universal quantified 
    variable, then introduce a Skolem function that depend on the universally 
    quantified variable. For example, <TT>(Ax)(Ey)P(x,y)</TT> is converted to 
    <TT>(Ax)P(x, f(x))</TT>. <TT>f</TT> is called a <B>Skolem function</B>, and 
    must be a brand new function name that does not occur in any other sentence 
    in the entire KB. 
    <UL>
      <LI>Example: <TT>(Ax)(Ey)loves(x,y)</TT> is converted to 
      <TT>(Ax)loves(x,f(x))</TT> where in this case <TT>f(x)</TT> specifies the 
      person that <TT>x</TT> loves. (If we knew that everyone loved their 
      mother, then <TT>f</TT> could stand for the <TT>mother-of</TT> function. 
      </LI></UL>
    <LI>Remove universal quantification symbols by first moving them all to the 
    left end and making the scope of each the entire sentence, and then just 
    dropping the "prefix" part. For example, convert <TT>(Ax)P(x)</TT> to 
    <TT>P(x)</TT>. 
    <LI>Distribute "and" over "or" to get a conjunction of disjunctions called 
    <B>conjunctive normal form</B>. Convert <TT>(P ^ Q) v R</TT> to <TT>(P v R) 
    ^ (Q v R)</TT>, and convert <TT>(P v Q) v R</TT> to <TT>(P v Q v R)</TT>. 
    <LI>Split each conjunct into a separate <B>clause</B>, which is just a 
    disjunction ("or") of negated and un-negated predicates, called 
    <B>literals</B>. 
    <LI>Standardize variables apart again so that each clause contains variable 
    names that do not occur in any other clause. </LI></OL>

<H3>Resolution Procedure as Search through a Search Space</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>Resolution procedure can be thought of as the bottom-up construction of a 
  search tree, where the leaves are the clauses produced by KB and the negation 
  of the goal. When a pair of clauses generates a new resolvent clause, add a 
  new node to the tree with arcs directed from the resolvent to the two parent 
  clauses. The resolution procedure succeeds when a node containing the 
  <I>False</I> clause is produced, becoming the root node of the tree. 
  <LI>A strategy is complete if its use guarantees that the empty clause (i.e., 
  <TT>false</TT>) can be derived whenever it is entailed 
  <LI>Some Strategies for Controlling Resolution's Search 
  <UL>
    <LI>Breadth-First 
    <UL>
      <LI>Level 0 clauses are those from the original axioms and the negation of 
      the goal. Level k clauses are the resolvents computed from two clauses, 
      one of which must be from level k-1 and the other from any earlier level. 
      <LI>Compute all level 1 clauses possible, then all possible level 2 
      clauses, etc. 
      <LI>Complete, but very inefficient. </LI></UL>
    <LI>Set-of-Support 
    <UL>
      <LI>At least one parent clause must be from the negation of the goal or 
      one of the "descendents" of such a goal clause (i.e., derived from a goal 
      clause) 
      <LI>Complete (assuming all possible set-of-support clauses are derived) 
      </LI></UL>
    <LI>Unit Resolution 
    <UL>
      <LI>At least one parent clause must be a "unit clause," i.e., a clause 
      containing a single literal 
      <LI>Not complete in general, but complete for Horn clause KBs </LI></UL>
    <LI>Input Resolution 
    <UL>
      <LI>At least one parent from the set of original clauses (from the axioms
