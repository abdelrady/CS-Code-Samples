Trimming the Frequently Used Programs List
Each time you run a program, Windows XP adds it to the list of frequently used programs you see
on the Start menu (see Figure 4?6). You might not want every program you open to appear in this
list, however. For example, I don't want to see Notepad in this list, nor do I want to see Command
Prompt. You can choose which programs do and don't pop up in this list by customizing
HKCR\Applications.

HKCR\Applications contains subkeys for a variety of programs that Windows XP knows about. The
name of each subkey is the name of the program file. Thus, you see the subkeys notepad.exe and
explorer.exe in HKCR\Applications. If you want to customize another program, add its subkey to this
key. For example, to customize whether Command Prompt appears in the list of frequently used
programs, add the subkey cmd.exe to HKCR\Applications. Then, to keep the program off of the list,
add the REG_SZ value NoStartPage to it.
