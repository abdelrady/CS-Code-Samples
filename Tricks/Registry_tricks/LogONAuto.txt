Logging On Automatically
Some users don't like having to log on to Windows XP. When they restart the computer, they want it
to boot all the way to the desktop without stopping at the Log On To Windows dialog box along the
way. Before I tell you that this is possible (oops), let me add that you should never skip the logon
process if your computer is connected to a business network. Obvious security concerns are
present when you allow anyone with access to your computer to have full access to all of its
contents and the network.
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon is where you configure the
ability to log on to Windows XP automatically. First you set the REG_SZ value AutoAdminLogon to
1, which turns on this feature. Just remember that this is a REG_SZ value and not a REG_DWORD
value. Next set the values DefaultUserName and DefaultPassword to the user name and password
that you want to use to log on to the operating system. Both are REG_SZ values. Last, set the
REG_SZ value DefaultDomainName to the name of the domain that's authenticating your name and
password. Table 4?8 summarizes these values, which you create if they don't already exist.
