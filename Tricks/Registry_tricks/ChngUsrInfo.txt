Changing User Information
On a regular basis, I get asked questions about changing user information. That's the information
you provided when you installed Windows XP. You can change it. Both of the following values are in
104
the key HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion:
· RegisteredOrganization. The name of the organization
· RegisteredOwner. The name of the user
Both are REG_SZ values. Changing the registered organization and owner names doesn't affect
installed applications. However, applications you install after changing these values are likely to pick
up the new names.
