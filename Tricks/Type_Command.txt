Notice that the RegEdit version that is supplied with Windows XP writes the registry file out
in Unicode format (each character is two bytes long). Editors and utilities that do not
understand Unicode character sets will have difficulty working with this file. To convert a
Unicode text file to one-byte text format, use the type command, with the output redirected to
a new file. For example:
type "file in unicode.reg" >"file in text.txt"
The new file created will be (within a byte or two) half the size of the original registry file that
you saved.
