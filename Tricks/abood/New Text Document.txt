The simplest and safest way to change a login screen is to use a quality third-party application such as Style XP 2.0 from TGTSoft or Logon Loader by Daniel Milner. If you feel comfortable doing it manually though, here are some excellent instructions courtesy of bFarber Logins. 

In Explorer, browse to C:\Windows\System32 and find the file named "logonui.exe". 
Rename "logonui.exe" to "logonui.exe.bak". This way if anything messes up...you have a backup. 
Place your new login in C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32 and rename it to logonui.exe. 
That's it! Now when you log off your new login screen will be there.
