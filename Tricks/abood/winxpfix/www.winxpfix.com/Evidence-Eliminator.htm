      <p align="left" class="style26"><strong>Thanks for the Discount!</strong> You do have the lowest price on the Internet for evidence eliminator. I happy with my order and fast download. I've told my friends to order evidence eliminator from here, because you have the lowest price. I installed evidence eliminator on my Pc and ran it. Boy, it really clean up my hard drive and freed up a lot of space, I think it even removed some spyware off my computer. I don't have to pay for a second hard drive after all, evidence eliminator freed enough  space, so i'm going to hold off on the new hard drive. Thanks! John S, USA </p>
      <p align="left" class="style26">I just downloaded and installed your product today. I love it! My 200 Mhz machine is noticeably faster and now has an additional 100+ meg of hard disk space available. I just ordered Evidence Eliminator this evening. This beats anything I've seen to date. Please keep up the good work!! RR, USA</p>
      <p align="left" class="style26">Great product - you need to get the message across more widely! Anyone with teenage sons knows how likely it is that something unwanted is lurking on the h/d... ...Well - most impressive! Somehow the whole product had a certain 'aura of 
  quality' about it and seemed worth buying... Seems I was right - money well spent! SC, UK</p>
      <p align="left" class="style26">Until I tried this unique product I had spent several hours each week manually reducing the size of my registry and trying to eliminate the numerous and bloated entries that had accumulated each time I installed software or just spent time on the internet. GC, USA</p>
      <p align="left" class="style26"><b>One satisfied customer!</b> - Eliminates hidden trace files , this program does what it says it does. when i ran it for the 1st time the program found over 2700 hidden internet explorer cache files on my hard drive. i lost track of all the other hidden files it found as well. overall i probably freed up close to 1 gig of hard drive space. programs like system mechanic will not find these hidden files ! very good program. it works great with windows me and 2000 with no problems :) Mike</p>
      <p align="left" class="style26"><b>Its worth the Money </b>- It's the best cleaning program i have used. i was busy trying to delete use things myself but it didn't work everyday I deleted a program but my disk was filling up, I didn't know why till I used Evidence Eliminator  and I deleted 2.5 gigabyte of useless junk I didn't even know I had it! Thanks, Eric</p>
      <p align="left" class="style26"><b>Thank you!,</b> I installed Evidence Eliminator and quite simply, no part of your machines history is left untouched, no excess file is left un-deleted, no hidden registry setting left registered, Evidence Eliminator kills them all. This is one severe program. It also speeds up your machine dramatically due to the fact that there are no excess files or registry entries left clogging up the file system. Very very VERY good! Thank you! Regard's Robert.</p>
