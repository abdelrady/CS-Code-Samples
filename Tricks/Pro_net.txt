LastBit Software produces a program called RegSnap that performs the process I described in this
section. You don't have to create any REG files or compare two REG files with a file?comparison
tool. RegSnap does the whole bit for you, making it a cool program to have around if you do this
sort of thing on a regular basis. You can download the shareware version of RegSnap from
http://www.webdon.com. Give it a try; if you like it, it's very inexpensive. It comes in a standard
edition and a professional edition. The professional edition enables you to work with remote
registries; otherwise, the standard edition is sufficient to locate a setting in the registry. The only
problem I have with RegSnap is that its user interface is very clunky.

interface. You can use it to edit and search the registry and to compare different versions of it.
RegView doesn't have a setup program, but it really doesn't need one. Figure 8?1 shows the result
in RegView of comparing a snapshot to the current registry. RegView's output is a little easier to
read than RegSnap's output, but RegView is quite a bit slower at producing it.
